"Alejandro ""Alex"" Padilla (born March 22, 1973) is an American politician and engineer serving as the senior United States senator from California, a seat he has held since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, Padilla served as the 30th secretary of state of California from 2015 to 2021 and was a member of the California State Senate and the Los Angeles City Council. Padilla was appointed to the United States Senate by Governor Gavin Newsom in 2021 after Kamala Harris was elected vice president of the United States; Harris, as the newly elected vice president and president of the Senate, swore Padilla in on January 18, 2021. Padilla won a special election to complete Harris's term as well as election to a full Senate term, in 2022. Padilla became California's senior senator on September 29, 2023, upon the death of Dianne Feinstein. == Early life and education == Padilla is one of three children of Santos and Lupe Padilla, both of whom moved from Mexico, specifically Jalisco and Chihuahua, before meeting and marrying in Los Angeles, where he was born on March 22, 1973. His parents were initially undocumented immigrants to the US, but later became citizens. His father worked as a short-order cook, and his mother as a housekeeper. He grew up in Pacoima, Los Angeles, and graduated from San Fernando High School in the northeast San Fernando Valley. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994. He graduated from the Coro Fellows Southern California Program in 1995. == Early career == === Los Angeles === After graduation, Padilla moved back to Pacoima and briefly worked as an engineer for Hughes Aircraft, where he wrote software for satellite systems. Padilla is a former member of the governing board of MIT and president of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), which has a membership of more than 6,000 Latino U.S. officials. He has chaired the Los Angeles Leadership Council for the American Diabetes Association since 2005. Padilla began in politics as a member of the Democratic Party in 1995, in part due to his response to California Proposition 187 (1994), which excluded illegal immigrants from all non-emergency public services, including public education. The proposition was criticized as a nativist backlash against Latin American immigrants, legal and illegal alike. Padilla's first professional role was as a personal assistant to Senator Dianne Feinstein. He then served as a campaign manager for Assemblyman Tony Cárdenas in 1996, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo in 1997, and State Senator Richard Alarcon in 1998, all Democrats. All won their elections. === Los Angeles City Council === On July 1, 1999, at age 26, Padilla was sworn in as a member of the Los Angeles City Council, succeeding Alarcon. Two years later, his colleagues elected him council president. Padilla was the first Latino and the youngest person elected president of the Los Angeles City Council, defeating incumbent Ruth Galanter. On September 13, 2001, two days after the 9/11 attacks, Padilla became the acting mayor of Los Angeles for a couple of days while Mayor James K. Hahn traveled out of the city. Los Angeles Times wrote that Padilla's rise to the mayor's office raised his ""political stock"".

"Amy Jean Klobuchar ( KLOH-bə-shar; born May 25, 1960) is an American politician and lawyer serving as the senior United States senator from Minnesota, a seat she has held since 2007. A member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), Minnesota's affiliate of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the county attorney of Hennepin County, Minnesota. Born in Plymouth, Minnesota, Klobuchar graduated from Yale University and the University of Chicago Law School. She was a partner at two Minneapolis law firms before being elected county attorney of Hennepin County in 1998, making her responsible for all criminal prosecution in Minnesota's most populous county. Klobuchar was first elected to the Senate in 2006, succeeding Mark Dayton to become Minnesota's first elected female United States senator. She became Minnesota's senior senator in 2009, when Norm Coleman left the Senate following his defeat. She was reelected by a landslide in 2012, winning 85 of the state's 87 counties, before being reelected again in 2018. Klobuchar's political positions align with modern liberalism. She has focused on healthcare reform, consumer protection, abortion rights, agriculture, and climate change. On February 10, 2019, Klobuchar announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in the 2020 election; on March 2, 2020, she suspended her campaign and endorsed Joe Biden. In 2021, she became the chair of the Senate Rules Committee. She was reelected to a fourth Senate term in 2024, defeating Republican nominee Royce White. In 2026, she filed to run for governor after incumbent Tim Walz withdrew from the race. == Early life and education == Born in Plymouth, Minnesota, Klobuchar is the daughter of Rose (née Heuberger) and Jim Klobuchar. Her mother taught second grade until she retired at age 70. Her father was a sportswriter and columnist for the Star Tribune. He was of Slovene descent and her mother of German-Swiss ancestry. Klobuchar's parents divorced when she was 15. The divorce took a toll on the family; her relationship with her father was not fully restored until he quit drinking in the 1990s. She attended public schools in Plymouth and was valedictorian at Wayzata High School, where she was also class treasurer and secretary. She received her Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude in political science in 1982 from Yale University. While at Yale, Klobuchar spent time as an intern for former Vice President and former Minnesota senator Walter Mondale. Her senior thesis, Uncovering the Dome, a 250-page history of the ten years of politics surrounding the building of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, was published by Waveland Press in 1986. After Yale, Klobuchar enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School, where she served as an associate editor of the University of Chicago Law Review and earned her J.D. degree with high honors in 1985. == Early career == After law school, Klobuchar worked as a corporate lawyer. Before seeking public office, besides working as a prosecutor, Klobuchar was a partner at the Minnesota law firms Dorsey & Whitney and Gray Plant Mooty, where she specialized in ""regulatory work in telecommunications law"". Her first foray into politics came after she gave birth and was forced to leave the hospital 24 hours later, a situation exacerbated by the fact that Klobuchar's daughter, Abigail, was born with a disorder",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,9452k05dlqquyat,,,Amy Klobuchar,senator,,250px_amy_klobuchar2c_official_portrait2c_113th_congress_28cropped29jpg_w2xnzrpqm7.jpg,,,amy-klobuchar,Minnesota,,,,,https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar,,

"Andrew Kim (born July 12, 1982) is an American politician and former diplomat serving as the junior United States senator from New Jersey since 2024. A progressive Democrat, he served from 2019 to 2024 as the U.S. representative from New Jersey's 3rd congressional district. Kim worked as a civilian advisor at the United States Department of State in Afghanistan during the Obama administration. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2018, defeating incumbent Tom MacArthur. With incumbent senator Bob Menendez facing corruption and bribery charges, Kim announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in September 2023. He won the Democratic primary after successfully petitioning to abolish ""county line"" primary ballots in New Jersey. Kim went on to win in the 2024 general election, becoming the first Korean-American in the Senate and the first Asian-American U.S. senator from New Jersey. == Early life and career == Kim was born on July 12, 1982, in Boston, Massachusetts, to South Korean immigrant parents, and grew up in South Jersey. His father was a geneticist and his mother was a nurse. Kim grew up in the Marlton section of Evesham Township, New Jersey, and attended Rice Elementary School before moving to Cherry Hill and graduating from Cherry Hill High School East in 2000. After two years at Deep Springs College, he transferred to the University of Chicago, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 2004 with a degree in political science. During college, Kim was an intern at the United States Agency for International Development and at the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. He later received a Rhodes Scholarship and a Harry S. Truman Scholarship to study international relations at Magdalen College, Oxford. At Oxford, Kim became friends with fellow Rhodes Scholar Pete Buttigieg, the future U.S. secretary of transportation from 2021 to 2025. Kim worked at the U.S. State Department. He served in Afghanistan as a civilian adviser to generals David Petraeus and John R. Allen before working as a national security adviser under President Barack Obama. Kim served as a United States National Security Council official. After the Sinjar massacre, Kim wrote the plan implemented by Obama to strike ISIS. == U.S. House of Representatives == === Elections === ==== 2018 ==== A resident of Bordentown Township, New Jersey, Kim ran against two-term incumbent Republican Tom MacArthur in the 2018 United States House of Representatives election after winning the June Democratic primary. Kim was endorsed by Barack Obama, former U.S. vice president Joe Biden, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy, and actress Piper Perabo. He said he was inspired to run by MacArthur's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. During the campaign, MacArthur sought to portray Kim as a D.C. elitist and outsider. In an ad run by the New Jersey Republican Party, Kim was described as ""Real Fishy"" in Wonton font on a picture of dead fish. The ad was criticized for its racial undertones. The race was considered too close to call on election night, but the next night, an influx of absentee ballots in Burlington County, home to the majority of the district's voters, gave Kim a 2,500-vote lead, prompting him to declare victory. MacArthur conceded eight days later. With a margin of victory of fewer than 4,000 votes, or slightly over 1% of votes cast, this",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,lo1ffimt1fk4h5j,,,Andy Kim,senator,,250px_sen_andy_kim_118th_congress_28cropped29jpg_2rxdmjip07.jpg,,,andy-kim,New Jersey,,,,,https://www.kim.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Kim,,

"Bernardo Moreno ( mər-EE-noh; born February 14, 1967) is an American politician and businessman serving since 2025 as the senior United States senator from Ohio. He is a member of the Republican Party. Moreno was born in Colombia to a family that soon immigrated to the United States, where he grew up in Florida. After attending the University of Michigan, he began a career in business. In 2005 he moved to Ohio, where he ran several car dealerships, mostly in Greater Cleveland, before becoming involved in blockchain companies in the late 2010s. He previously ran for Senate in 2022, but withdrew before the Republican primary. In 2024, Moreno defeated three-term incumbent Democratic senator Sherrod Brown. He became Ohio's junior senator on January 3, 2025, and became Ohio's senior senator a week later, when JD Vance resigned from the Senate to become vice president of the United States. Moreno is the first Hispanic American senator from Ohio and one of the first two Colombian American U.S. senators, along with Ruben Gallego of Arizona. == Early life, family, and education == Moreno was born in Bogotá, Colombia, on February 14, 1967. His father, Bernardo Moreno Mejía, was a physician and held high-ranking positions in the Colombian government. When Moreno was five, the family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he was raised. His father worked as a surgical assistant, and his mother was a real estate agent. Moreno became a U.S. citizen at age 18. Moreno attended the University of Michigan, graduating with a bachelor's degree in business administration. After it was publicized that his Cleveland Foundation biography incorrectly included a Master of Business Administration degree, his Senate campaign blamed the error on ""a staffer who made a mistake"". == Early career == After college, Moreno worked at General Motors. At 26, he moved to Massachusetts to become the general manager at The Herb Chambers Companies, a car dealership for the General Motors division Saturn. He relocated to Ohio in 2005 and bought a Mercedes-Benz dealership in North Olmsted near Cleveland. Moreno was the president of the Collection Auto Group, a car dealership company. By 2016, he owned more than a dozen dealerships, mostly located in Ohio. In 2019, he began to sell a number of his dealerships to focus on his new blockchain-based technology company, Ownum. In 2018, Moreno established the Sales Center for Excellence at Cleveland State University. In 2019, Moreno was elected to the Cleveland Business Hall of Fame in Cleveland Magazine. Moreno was appointed to the board of trustees for the MetroHealth System in October 2019 and served until he resigned in February 2021 to focus on seeking public office. In 2023, Moreno settled over a dozen wage theft lawsuits prior to launching his U.S. Senate campaign. He was ordered to pay over $400,000 to two former employees. He was rebuked by a state judge for shredding documents potentially related to the case. A March 2024 report found that Moreno had faced two lawsuits alleging gender and age-based discrimination; Moreno's campaign responded by saying both employees who sued him supported his Senate campaign. == U.S. Senate == === Elections === ==== 2022 ==== In April 2021, Moreno entered the race for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate to replace the retiring incumbent Rob Portman.

In 2008, he was elected as the U.S. representative for Louisiana's 6th congressional district, defeating Democratic incumbent Don Cazayoux. Cassidy was elected to the Senate in 2014, defeating Democratic incumbent Mary Landrieu. He was reelected in 2020. A moderate Republican, Cassidy is a critic of President Donald Trump. In 2021, he was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial. As a result, the Republican Party of Louisiana censured him. In 2023, after Trump was indicted for mishandling classified documents, Cassidy called for Trump to drop out of the 2024 presidential election. After Trump secured the Republican nomination, Cassidy declined to endorse him in the general election. == Early life and education == William Morgan Cassidy was born in Highland Park, Illinois, one of four sons of Elizabeth and James F.

He specialized in the treatment of liver disease at the Earl K. Long Medical Center (LSUMC). In 1998, Cassidy helped found the Greater Baton Rouge Community Clinic to provide uninsured residents of the greater Baton Rouge area with access to free health care. The Clinic provides low-income families with free dental, medical, mental health, and vision care through a ""virtual"" approach that partners needy patients with doctors who provide care free of charge. Cassidy has also been involved in setting up the nonprofit Health Centers in Schools, which vaccinates children in the East Baton Rouge Parish School System against hepatitis B and flu. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Cassidy led a group of health care volunteers to convert an abandoned Kmart into an emergency health care facility, providing basic health care to hurricane victims. In 2010, Cassidy's alma mater, Louisiana State University, selected him for honoris causa membership in Omicron Delta Kappa, the National Leadership Honor Society. === Politics === Cassidy was first elected to the Louisiana State Senate in 2006 as a Republican.

"Brian Emanuel Schatz ( SHAHTS; born October 20, 1972) is an American politician serving since 2012 as a United States senator from Hawaii. A progressive Democrat, Schatz served in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 1998 to 2006, representing the 25th legislative district; as the chairman of the Democratic Party of Hawaii from 2008 to 2010; and as the 12th lieutenant governor of Hawaii from 2010 to 2012. Schatz also worked as chief executive officer of Helping Hands Hawaii, an Oahu nonprofit social service agency, until he resigned to run for lieutenant governor of Hawaii in the 2010 gubernatorial election as Neil Abercrombie's running mate. He served as lieutenant governor until December 26, 2012, when Abercrombie appointed him to serve the rest of Daniel Inouye's U.S. Senate term after Inouye's death. Schatz was the youngest U.S. senator in the 112th Congress. He won the 2014 special election to complete the remainder of Inouye's Senate term with just under 70% of the vote, and was reelected in 2016 and in 2022. == Early life == Brian Schatz was born into a Jewish-American family in Ann Arbor, Michigan, along with an identical twin brother, Steve. He is the son of Barbara Jane (née Binder) and Irwin Jacob Schatz, a cardiologist and native of the Saint Boniface neighborhood of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Schatz's father was the first to complain about the ethics of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, in a 1965 letter. The letter was ignored until the problem finally came to public attention in 1972. Irwin Schatz wrote that he was ""astounded"" that ""physicians allow patients with potentially fatal disease to remain untreated when effective therapy is available."" Brian Schatz said that his father didn't talk about the letter, but that it influenced him to pursue the public good. When Schatz and his brother were two years old, the family moved to Hawaii, where Schatz graduated from Punahou School. Schatz enrolled at Pomona College in Claremont, California; he spent a term studying abroad in Kenya on a program of the School for International Training (SIT). He graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. == Early career == After college, Schatz returned to Hawaii, where he taught at Punahou before taking other jobs in the nonprofit sector. He was briefly a member of the Green Party. Schatz had become active in the community as a teenager through his involvement in Youth for Environmental Services. He then served as CEO of Helping Hands Hawaii and director of the Makiki Community Library and of the Center for a Sustainable Future. In March 2010, Schatz stepped down from Helping Hands to run for lieutenant governor. He was a member of the 2007 class of the Pacific Century Fellows. == Hawaii House of Representatives (1998–2006) == In 1998, Schatz challenged the incumbent State Representative of the 24th district of the Hawaii House of Representatives, Republican Sam Aiona, and won, 53%–47%. In the 2000 rematch he was reelected, 57%–43%. In 2002 he ran in the newly redrawn 25th House district, and defeated Republican Bill Hols, 69%–31%. In 2004 he defeated Republican Tracy Okubo, 64%–36%. The 25th district includes Makiki and Tantalus on Oahu. == Subsequent political career (2006–2010) == === 2006 congressional election === Schatz ran for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district, vacated by Ed Case, who had",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,m6spkrfo2zo375r,,,Brian Schatz,senator,,250px_brian_schatz2c_official_portrait2c_113th_congress_2_28cropped29jpg_2zsgr78i5x.jpg,,,brian-schatz,Hawaii,,,,,https://www.schatz.senate.gov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%20Schatz,,

"Catherine Marie Cortez Masto (born March 29, 1964) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the senior United States senator from Nevada, a seat she has held since 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, Cortez Masto served as the 32nd attorney general of Nevada from 2007 to 2015. Cortez Masto graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno and Gonzaga University School of Law. She worked four years as a civil attorney in Las Vegas and two years as a criminal prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C. before being elected Nevada attorney general in 2006, replacing George Chanos. Reelected in 2010, she was not eligible to run for a third term in 2014 because of lifetime term limits established by the Constitution of Nevada. Cortez Masto narrowly defeated Republican Joe Heck in the 2016 United States Senate election in Nevada to replace outgoing Democratic senator Harry Reid, becoming the first woman elected to represent Nevada in the Senate and the first Latina elected to serve in the upper chamber. She took office on January 3, 2017, and became Nevada's senior senator in January 2019, when Dean Heller left the Senate following his defeat. She was narrowly reelected in 2022, defeating Republican nominee Adam Laxalt. == Early life and education == Cortez Masto was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, the daughter of Joanna (née Musso) and Manny Cortez. Her father, an attorney, was the longtime head of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and served as a member of the Clark County Commission. Now deceased, Manny Cortez had a long-standing friendship with Harry Reid. Her father was of Mexican descent, and her mother is of Italian ancestry. Her paternal grandfather, Eduardo Cortez, immigrated to Nevada from Chihuahua, Mexico. Cortez Masto attended Ed W. Clark High School, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from the University of Nevada, Reno in 1986 and a Juris Doctor from Gonzaga University School of Law in 1990. == Early career == Cortez Masto was admitted to the State Bar of Nevada in 1990, the U.S. District Court, the District of Nevada in 1991, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 1994. Her career includes four years as a civil attorney in Las Vegas and two as a criminal prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C. She also served as former Nevada Governor Bob Miller's chief of staff. In November 2003, Cortez Masto was named executive vice chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education. There was some controversy, because she was hired directly by the chancellor, not the university system's board of regents; the chancellor said the regents had recommended that he hire an assistant, and in December the board voted unanimously to approve her annual salary of $215,000. === Nevada Attorney General === Cortez Masto was the Democratic nominee for state attorney general in 2006 and defeated Republican nominee Don Chairez 59% to 36%, with 5% for ""None of these"". She was reelected in 2010, defeating Republican Travis Barrick 52% to 36%, with 8% for Independent American candidate Joel F. Hansen and 4% for ""None of these"". In 2009, Cortez Masto's office launched an investigation into Brian Krolicki, then Nevada's Republican lieutenant governor.

"Christopher Van Hollen Jr. ( van HOL-ən; born January 10, 1959) is an American attorney and politician serving as the senior United States senator from Maryland, a seat he has held since 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the U.S. representative for Maryland's 8th congressional district from 2003 to 2017 and as a Maryland state senator from 1995 to 2003. In 2007, Van Hollen became the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). In this post, he was responsible for leading efforts to defend vulnerable Democrats and get more Democrats elected to Congress in 2008, which led to a wave election for Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created a new leadership post, Assistant to the Speaker, in 2006 so that Van Hollen could be present at all leadership meetings. He was elected ranking member on the Budget Committee on November 17, 2010. Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to the 12-member bipartisan Committee on Deficit Reduction with a mandate for finding major budget reductions by late 2011. On October 17, 2013, Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to serve on the bicameral conference committee. Van Hollen ran for the United States Senate in 2016 to replace retiring Senator Barbara Mikulski. He defeated U.S. Representative Donna Edwards in the Democratic primary and won the general election with 61% of the vote to Republican nominee Kathy Szeliga's 36%. He was reelected in 2022 with nearly 66% of the vote to Republican nominee Chris Chaffee's 34%. Van Hollen chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) from 2017 to 2019. Van Hollen became Maryland's senior senator when Ben Cardin retired from the Senate in 2025. Van Hollen is set to become the dean of Maryland's congressional delegation in 2027 with long-time Representative Steny Hoyer announcing his retirement in early 2026. == Early life, education, and career == Van Hollen was born in Karachi, Pakistan, the eldest of three children of American parents, Edith Eliza (née Farnsworth) and Christopher Van Hollen. His father was a Foreign Service officer who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs (1969–1972) and U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives (1972–1976); his mother worked in the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department, where she served as chief of the intelligence bureau for South Asia. He spent parts of his early life in Pakistan, Turkey, India, and Sri Lanka. He returned to the United States for his junior year of high school, and attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where his grandfather had once taught.

He continued his studies at Harvard University, where he earned a Master of Public Policy concentrating in national security studies from the John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1985. He then earned a Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1990. == Early political career == Van Hollen worked as a legislative assistant for defense and foreign policy to U.S. Senator Charles Mathias, a Republican from Maryland, from 1985 to 1987.

"Charles Ernest Grassley (born September 17, 1933) is an American politician serving since 2025 as the president pro tempore of the United States Senate, a position he also held from 2019 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, Grassley is the senior U.S. senator from Iowa, serving since 1981. Since 2023, he has been the 45th dean of the United States Senate. Before becoming a senator, Grassley served eight terms in the Iowa House of Representatives (1959–1975) and three terms in the United States House of Representatives (1975–1981). He served three stints as Senate Finance Committee chairman during periods of Republican Senate majority. Upon the retirement of Orrin Hatch on January 3, 2019, Grassley became the Senate's most senior Republican and its president pro tempore. Upon Patrick Leahy's retirement in January 2023, Grassley became the most senior member of the Senate. At 92 years, 4 months and 8 days old, Grassley is the oldest sitting United States senator, the longest-serving Republican in congressional history, and the sixth-longest-serving U.S. senator in history. He served as president pro tempore emeritus of the Senate from 2021 to 2025. During his four decades in the Senate, Grassley has chaired the Finance Committee, the Narcotics Control Caucus, the Judiciary Committee, and the Aging Committee. == Early life and education == Grassley was born on September 17, 1933 in New Hartford, Iowa. He is the son of Ruth (née Corwin) and Louis Arthur Grassley. He was the third of five children, having two brothers and two sisters. In August 1920, Ruth Grassley was among the first four women to vote in Iowa. Her son did not know about this until many years after her death, when a constituent showed him an article about it. The women had voted in a school election. In 2019, he gave a speech describing her achievement. Grassley was raised on a farm; his childhood home did not have electricity or indoor plumbing. Grassley graduated from New Hartford Community High School in 1951. At Iowa State Teachers College (now the University of Northern Iowa), he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1955 and a Master of Arts in political science in 1956. He pursued a Ph.D. in political science at the University of Iowa, but did not complete the degree. During his time as a student, Grassley joined the social-professional Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity. In 1955, Grassley's brother Louis Grassley Jr. died as a result of a traffic accident in New Hartford. In 2014, Chuck became the last Grassley sibling alive when his sister Genevieve died. His brother Kenneth died in 2001 and his sister Lois in 2006. == Early career == In the 1950s, Grassley farmed and worked in factories in Iowa, first as a sheet metal shearer and then as an assembly line worker. From 1967 to 1968, he taught at Charles City College. Grassley represented parts of Butler County in the Iowa House of Representatives from 1959 to 1975. He then served in the United States House of Representatives from 1975 to 1981. == U.S. Senate == === Tenure === ==== 1981–1989 ==== In November 1981, Grassley was one of 32 senators to sign a letter to President Reagan supporting Director of the Office of Management and Budget David Stockman.

"Cindy Hyde-Smith (née Hyde; born May 10, 1959) is an American politician and lobbyist serving since 2018 as the junior United States senator from Mississippi. A member of the Republican Party, she served from 2012 to 2018 as the Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce and from 2000 to 2012 in the Mississippi State Senate. Born in Brookhaven, Mississippi, Hyde-Smith is a graduate of Copiah–Lincoln Community College and the University of Southern Mississippi. In 1999, she was elected to the Mississippi State Senate as a Democrat. She represented the 39th district from 2000 to 2012. In 2010, Hyde-Smith switched parties and became a Republican, citing her conservative beliefs. Hyde-Smith was elected Mississippi agriculture commissioner in 2011; she is the first woman to be elected to that office, and she was reelected in 2015. On March 21, 2018, Governor Phil Bryant announced his intention to appoint Hyde-Smith to the United States Senate seat being vacated due to the resignation of Thad Cochran. Hyde-Smith was sworn into office on April 9, 2018. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress. Hyde-Smith won the 2018 special election for the remainder of Cochran's term, and was reelected in 2020. == Early life == Hyde-Smith was born in Brookhaven, Mississippi, the daughter of Lorraine Hyde and Luther Hyde, and grew up in Monticello, Mississippi. She attended Lawrence County Academy in Monticello, a segregation academy established in response to Supreme Court rulings ordering the desegregation of public schools. The school's team nickname was the Rebels; the mascot was a ""Col. Reb"" who carried a Confederate flag. Hyde-Smith graduated from Copiah–Lincoln Community College with an Associate of Arts (AA) and the University of Southern Mississippi with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in criminal justice and political science. She is one of the few U.S. senators who attended community college. After her studies, she worked as a lobbyist for the Southern Coalition for Safer Highways and National Coalition for Healthcare, with offices in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. She served as the state director for Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee during her time with the National Coalition for Healthcare, which advocated nationwide healthcare coverage. == Mississippi Senate == Hyde-Smith was a member of the Mississippi Senate, representing the 39th District from 2000 to 2012. For part of her tenure, she chaired the Senate Agriculture Committee, which led her Senate colleagues to encourage her to run for Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce. She had a conservative voting record in the state Senate. During her time in the state Senate, 79 of her bills became law. She supported measures to collect DNA samples from people in custody of the Department of Corrections and authored a bill to ban most abortions after 12 weeks. After the abortion restriction bill passed and was signed by then-Governor Haley Barbour, it was overturned in federal court. On the Senate Agriculture Committee, Hyde-Smith also helped manage the fallout from a controversial beef plant that defaulted on a $55 million state loan. The state sued firms involved in the construction of a 400-employee plant in Yalobusha County that closed three months after it opened, in August 2004. The state eventually settled with the plant owners for $4 million.

"Debra Lynelle Fischer (née Strobel; born March 1, 1951) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from Nebraska, a seat she has held since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, Fischer served in the Nebraska Legislature from 2005 to 2013 and on the Valentine Rural High School Board of Education from 1990 to 2004. She is the third woman to represent Nebraska in the U.S. Senate (after Eva Bowring and Hazel Abel) and the first to be reelected. Fischer was first elected to the Senate in 2012, defeating former Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey after an upset victory against state attorney general Jon Bruning in the Republican primary. She was reelected in 2018 and 2024. == Early life, education, and career == Fischer was born Debra Lynelle Strobel on March 1, 1951, in Lincoln, Nebraska. She is the daughter of Florence M. (née Bock) and Gerold Carl Strobel. Her father was the State Engineer/Director of the Nebraska Department of Roads under Governors Kay Orr and Ben Nelson and her mother was an elementary school teacher with Lincoln Public Schools. In 1972, Strobel married Bruce Fischer, a man from Valentine, Nebraska, she met at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. She and her husband raised three sons on the Fischer family cattle ranch south of Valentine. In 1987, she returned to the university and completed her Bachelor of Science degree in education. == School board (1990–2004) == In 1990, Fischer was elected to the Valentine Rural High School Board of Education, serving until 2004. Governor Mike Johanns appointed Fischer as a Commissioner to the Nebraska Coordinating Commission for Post-Secondary Education from 2000 to 2004. == Nebraska Legislature (2005–2013) == === Elections === In 2004, Fischer ran for the Nebraska Legislature from the 43rd legislative district in the state's Sandhills region. In the nonpartisan primary, she came in second in a field of seven, receiving 2,226 votes (25.1%); front-runner Kevin T. Cooksley received 2,264 votes (25.5%). In the general election, she defeated Cooksley with 8,178 votes to his 8,050, a margin of 50.4%–49.6%. In 2008, she won reelection unopposed. Nebraska's term-limits law precluded her running for reelection in 2012. Tenure Fischer's district was geographically the largest in the Nebraska Legislature, comprising 12 counties and part of a 13th. During her tenure in the legislature, she did a weekly radio show on seven stations covering her district, and wrote a weekly column printed in several newspapers. In 2007, Fischer helped lead a filibuster against a bill to create a statewide smoking ban for indoor workplaces and public places. Commonly known as the Nebraska Clean Indoor Air Act, the bill passed and was signed into law in 2008. In 2009, Fischer was one of 14 co-sponsors of L.B. 675, which required abortion providers to display ultrasound images of the fetus at least one hour before performing abortions, in a position where the abortion seeker could easily view them. A spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee said the law was stronger than those of other states, which required only that the client be asked whether she wanted to see an ultrasound image. The measure passed by a 40–5 vote, and was signed into law by Governor Dave Heineman. Fischer chaired the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee and helped pass the BUILD",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,li8uial90zgbv37,,,Deb Fischer,senator,,250px_sen_deb_fischer_28r_ne292c_official_portrait2c_118th_united_states_congress_28cropped29jpg_brhfgi9px5.jpg,,,deb-fischer,Nebraska,,,,,https://www.fischer.senate.gov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_Fischer,,

"Elissa Blair Slotkin ( SLOT-kin; born July 10, 1976) is an American politician and former intelligence analyst serving since 2025 as the junior United States senator from Michigan. A member of the Democratic Party, she served in the United States House of Representatives from 2019 to 2025. Slotkin was a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst and Department of Defense official, ending her career there as the acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In 2018, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Michigan's 8th congressional district. Slotkin was elected to the Senate in 2024, defeating Republican nominee Mike Rogers in a close race. She became the second female senator from Michigan after Debbie Stabenow. She is expected to become Michigan's senior senator when Gary Peters retires in 2027. == Early life and education == Slotkin was born on July 10, 1976, in New York City, the daughter of Judith (née Spitz) Slotkin and Curt Slotkin. She spent her early life on a farm in Holly, Michigan. She attended Cranbrook Kingswood School in Bloomfield Hills. Her family farm was part of Hygrade Meat Company, founded by her great-grandfather Samuel Slotkin, who emigrated from Minsk in 1900. Hygrade was the original company behind Ball Park Franks, which is now owned by Tyson Foods. Judith and Curt divorced, and Judith came out as gay, in 1986, during the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Slotkin and her brother moved in with their mom. Their home was a gathering place for Detroit's covert but vibrant LGBTQ+ community. Her father was a longtime Republican and Ronald Reagan supporter whose worldview she agreed with during her childhood. Slotkin has said that she became a Democrat because of the Reagan administration's indifference to the widespread suffering of those with AIDS, which greatly affected her. Slotkin attended agricultural school at Cornell University, where in 1998 she earned a Bachelor of Arts in sociology. Slotkin was a community organizer for Roca, Incorporated in Chelsea, Massachusetts, from 1998 to 2000, and a Swahili language translator for Harbor Area Early Childhood in East Boston, Massachusetts from 1999 to 2000. In 2000–2001 she was a grant writer for Isha L'Isha (co-founded by Gail Dines). In 2001, Slotkin completed a course in the Arabic language at the American University in Cairo. In 2003, she earned a master of international affairs from Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. == Early career == Slotkin interned at the U.S. Department of State (2002). She worked as a political analyst (2003–2004) and intelligence briefer (2004–2005) for the Central Intelligence Agency. From 2005 to 2006, she was a senior assistant on the staff of the Director of National Intelligence. She was the leader of a CIA assessment team in Iraq from 2006 to 2007, and the National Security Council staff's director for Iraq policy from 2007 to 2009. From 2009 to 2011, Slotkin was a senior advisor on Iraq policy at the U.S. State Department and in 2011 she joined the staff of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy as an advisor on Middle East policy. In 2012, Slotkin became chief of staff for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Policy and later that year was appointed Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Policy. She was appointed Principal Deputy Under",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,qlz3ztetwzk87j9,,,Elissa Slotkin,senator,,250px_elissa_slotkin_119th_congress_28cropped29jpg_y7z9femy6q.jpg,,,elissa-slotkin,Michigan,,,,,https://www.slotkin.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elissa_Slotkin,,
"Elizabeth Ann Warren (née Herring; born June 22, 1949) is an American politician and former law professor who is the senior United States senator from the state of Massachusetts, serving since 2013. A member of the Democratic Party and regarded as a progressive, Warren has focused on consumer protection, equitable economic opportunity, and the social safety net while in the Senate. Warren was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, ultimately finishing third after Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Born and raised in Oklahoma, Warren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School. She has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University, with expertise in bankruptcy and commercial law. Warren has written 12 books and more than 100 articles. Warren's first foray into public policy began in 1995, when she worked to oppose what eventually became a 2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals. During the late 2000s, her national profile grew after her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent banking regulations after the 2008 financial crisis. She served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and proposed and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for which she served as the first special advisor under President Barack Obama. In 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott Brown and became the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts. She was reelected by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl. On February 9, 2019, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election. She was briefly considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in late 2019, but support for her campaign dwindled. She withdrew from the race on March 5, 2020, after Super Tuesday. She was reelected to a third Senate term in 2024 against Republican nominee John Deaton. == Early life and education == Warren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949. She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (née Reed, 1912–1995), a homemaker, and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II, both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church. Warren has described her early family life as teetering ""on the ragged edge of the middle class"" and ""kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails."" She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist. Warren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work. After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building. Eventually, the family's car was repossessed because they failed to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog-order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant. Warren became a star member of the debate team at Northwest Classen High School and won the state high school debating championship.

Schmitt served as the 46th state treasurer of Missouri from 2017 to 2019 and as the 43rd Missouri attorney general from 2019 to 2023. Schmitt began his political career as an alderman for Glendale, Missouri. From 2009 to 2017, he represented the 15th district in the Missouri Senate, during which he sponsored major reductions in the state income tax and franchise tax, and expanded benefits and tax exemptions for disabled citizens. As a state senator, Schmitt also led a bipartisan effort in response to the Ferguson unrest to successfully eliminate traffic ticket quotas and limit local revenues from non-traffic fines. In 2016, Schmitt was elected State Treasurer of Missouri. In 2018, Governor Mike Parson appointed Schmitt Missouri Attorney General. He was elected to a full four-year term as attorney general in 2020. As attorney general, he filed or joined lawsuits seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election (in Texas v. Pennsylvania), and, on 25 occasions, oppose the policies of the Joe Biden administration. He also sued school districts and municipalities for implementing mask requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic and sued the government of China and Chinese Communist Party for their alleged role in the pandemic. In 2022, Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating Democratic nominee Trudy Busch Valentine. He is the vice chair of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. As a senator, Schmitt supports national conservative, and was a speaker at the 2025 National Conservatism Conference. == Early life and education == Schmitt was born in Bridgeton, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. He graduated from DeSmet Jesuit High School in 1993 and from Truman State University in 1997, with a BA in political science. At Truman, Schmitt was a member of the Alpha Kappa Lambda fraternity, played football and baseball, and was a founding member of Truman's Habitat for Humanity chapter. He received a scholarship to attend Saint Louis University School of Law, where he earned his JD in 2000. == Personal life == For the fall 2018 semester, Schmitt was an adjunct faculty member at Saint Louis University. He and his family are Catholic. == Early law and political career == === Lawyer and Glendale alderman === Schmitt was admitted to the Missouri bar in 2000. He was a partner at the firm Lathrop & Gage, LLP in Clayton, Missouri. Schmitt served as an alderman for Glendale, Missouri, from 2005 to 2008; he was one of two aldermen for Ward 3. === Missouri Senate (2009–2017) === On November 4, 2008, Schmitt was elected to the Missouri Senate. He represented the 15th district, which includes parts of central and western St. Louis County. Following the 2010 census, Schmitt's district was redrawn, but still centered around central St. Louis County. Schmitt ran unopposed in both the primary and general elections in 2012. In 2016, Schmitt sponsored S.B. 572, which set a limit on the percent of revenue that Missouri local governments could obtain from non-traffic fines (such as fines for violation of city ordinances). The bill passed the state Senate in a 25–6 vote in January 2016. After the Ferguson unrest, Schmitt said that",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,65powuq5wblz2vr,,,Eric Schmitt,senator,,250px_sen_eric_schmitt2c_official_portrait2c_118th_congress_28cropped_229jpg_de3271xmy6.jpg,,,eric-schmitt,Missouri,,,,,https://www.schmitt.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric%20Schmitt,,

"Jacklyn Sheryl Rosen (née Spektor; born August 2, 1957) is an American politician serving as the junior United States senator from Nevada since 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the U.S. representative for Nevada's 3rd congressional district from 2017 to 2019. Rosen was elected to the Senate in 2018, defeating Republican incumbent Dean Heller with 50.4% of the vote. Rosen was reelected in 2024, defeating Republican nominee Sam Brown. == Early life and career == Rosen was born on August 2, 1957, in Chicago, Illinois, to Carol, a homemaker, and Leonard Spektor, a car dealership owner who had served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. Rosen's mother was of Irish, German, and Austrian descent, and her father's family were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Austria. Rosen attended the University of Minnesota and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology in 1979. While she was in college, her parents moved to Las Vegas, where Rosen moved after graduating. She took a job with Summa Corporation and worked summers as a waitress at Caesars Palace throughout the 1980s. While working for Summa, she attended Clark County Community College (College of Southern Nevada) and received an associate degree in computing and information technology in 1985. She began working for Southwest Gas from 1990 to 1993. Rosen has touted her efforts to ""build a business"", but a Reno Gazette-Journal review of public records found no evidence that she held a state or local business license. According to Rosen, she ran a company between 1993 and 2002, of which she was the only employee. Her business served two main clients, Southwest Gas, which was Rosen's former employer, and Radiology Specialists, a Las Vegas-based physician group that employed Rosen's husband. == U.S. House of Representatives == === Elections === ==== 2016 ==== A former computer programmer with no political experience at the time, Rosen was asked by U.S. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, also from Nevada, to run in the 2016 election for the U.S. House seat being vacated by Republican Joe Heck. On January 26, she declared her candidacy for Nevada's 3rd congressional district. Rosen won 60% of the vote in the Democratic primary election and narrowly defeated Republican nominee Danny Tarkanian in the general election. She was sworn into office on January 3, 2017. === Committee assignments === Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Energy Subcommittee on Research and Technology === Caucus memberships === Congressional Arts Caucus Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues Problem Solvers Caucus Congressional Coalition on Adoption == U.S. Senate == === Elections === ==== 2018 ==== Rosen was elected to the U.S. Senate on November 6, 2018, defeating one-term Republican senator Dean Heller to become the junior senator from Nevada. Her candidacy, announced on July 5, 2017, was endorsed by former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden. During the campaign, Rosen emphasized her support for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and criticized Heller's vote to repeal it in 2017. At the time, Rosen voted in the U.S. House against Republicans' attempts to repeal Obamacare. Rosen defeated Heller, 50.4% to 45.4%.

"Cynthia Jeanne Shaheen ( JEEN shə-HEEN; née Bowers, born January 28, 1947) is an American politician and former educator serving since 2009 as the senior United States senator from New Hampshire. A member of the Democratic Party, she served from 1997 to 2003 as the 78th governor of New Hampshire. Shaheen is the first woman elected both governor and a U.S. senator, and was the first elected female governor of New Hampshire. After serving two terms in the New Hampshire Senate, Shaheen was elected governor in 1996 and reelected in 1998 and 2000. In 2002, she unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate against Republican nominee John E. Sununu. She served as director of the Harvard Institute of Politics before resigning to run for the U.S. Senate again in the 2008 election, defeating Sununu in a rematch. She has been the dean of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation since 2011, when Senator Judd Gregg retired. Shaheen became the first Democratic senator from New Hampshire since John A. Durkin. In 2014, she became the second Democrat from New Hampshire to be reelected to the Senate since Thomas J. McIntyre in 1972. She was reelected in 2020. On March 12, 2025, she announced that she would not seek reelection in 2026. == Early life and education == Jeanne Shaheen was born Cynthia Jeanne Bowers in St. Charles, Missouri, the daughter of Belle Ernestine (Stillings) and Ivan E. Bowers. Shaheen graduated from high school in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, and earned a bachelor's degree in English from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania and a master's degree in political science from the University of Mississippi. She taught high school in Mississippi and moved to New Hampshire in 1973, where she also taught school. == Personal life == Shaheen is married to William Shaheen, an attorney and judge. They have three children together. Their daughter Stefany Shaheen is a candidate for New Hampshire's 1st congressional district in 2026. She publicly opposed her mother's position on the 2025 federal government shutdown. Jeanne and William Shaheen formerly owned a store in New Hampshire that sold used jewelry. In June 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a press release alleging that Senator Shaheen intervened to remove her husband from enhanced Transportation Security Administration (TSA) scrutiny. After she contacted TSA, he was reportedly removed from the list and exempted from enhanced screening. DHS characterized this as evidence of politicization in the Biden administration's watchlisting process and accused the program of being used to benefit political allies. == Early political career == As a Democrat, she worked on several campaigns, including Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, and as the New Hampshire campaign manager for Gary Hart in 1984, before running for office in 1990, when she was elected to the state Senate for the 21st district. She was elected governor of New Hampshire in 1996 and reelected in 1998 and 2000. In April 2005, Shaheen was named director of Harvard's Institute of Politics, succeeding former U.S. Representative and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman. == Governor of New Hampshire == Shaheen's decision to run for New Hampshire governor followed the retirement of Republican Governor Steve Merrill. Her opponent in 1996 was Ovide M. Lamontagne, then chairman of the State Board of Education. Shaheen presented herself as a moderate. According to a PBS profile, she",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,99xsn3e1kyuuqwb,,,Jeanne Shaheen,senator,,250px_shaheen_senate_portrait_28cropped29_28cropped29jpg_2oo5kimwei.jpg,,,jeanne-shaheen,New Hampshire,,,,,https://www.shaheen.senate.gov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Shaheen,,

"Jeffrey Alan Merkley (born October 24, 1956) is an American politician who is the junior United States senator from Oregon. He was first elected to the Senate in 2008. A member of the Democratic Party, he served from 1999 to 2009 as the representative for the 47th district in the Oregon House of Representatives, which covers central Multnomah County on the eastern side of Portland, Oregon; he was the speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives during the last two years of his tenure. Merkley defeated two-term Republican incumbent U.S. Senator Gordon Smith in 2008 and was reelected in 2014 and 2020, defeating Republican nominees Monica Wehby and Jo Rae Perkins. During his tenure, Merkley has been an advocate of progressivism and was the only U.S. senator to endorse Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. He was considered a potential candidate for president in 2020, but chose to run for reelection to the Senate instead. == Early life, education, and early career == Jeffrey Alan Merkley was born on October 24, 1956, the son of Darrell Philip Merkley and his wife Betty Lou (Collins). He attended first grade in Roseburg, Oregon, before moving to Portland with his family. He graduated from David Douglas High School, received a Bachelor of Arts degree in international relations from Stanford University in 1979, and earned a Master of Public Affairs degree from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University in 1982. After completing his master's degree, Merkley was selected as a Presidential Management Fellow, working at the Office of the Secretary of Defense on the security of American military technology. After his fellowship, he worked in the Congressional Budget Office, where he analyzed nuclear weapons policies and programs. In 1991 Merkley returned to Portland, where he served as executive director of Portland Habitat for Humanity until 1994. Merkley started the Walk for Humanity, initiated the Journey for Mankind, launched development of the Habitat Home Building Center, and initiated a pilot project for ""YouthBuild"" in which gang-affected youth built homes in their own neighborhoods. He also served as Director of Housing Development at Human Solutions, where he worked to make available affordable housing complexes and launched Oregon's first Individual Development Account (IDA) program, which helps low-income families save money to buy homes, attend college, or start businesses. Merkley was president of the World Affairs Council of Oregon for seven years and continued to serve on the board of trustees. == Oregon legislature == In 1998 Merkley was elected as a Democrat to the Oregon House of Representatives from the 16th district in east Portland (renumbered as the 47th district after the 2002 redistricting). He succeeded Frank Shields, who moved from the House to the Oregon State Senate due to term limits.

A graduate of Indiana University Bloomington, Banks served on the Whitley County Council before being elected to the State Senate in 2010. During his tenure, he joined the United States Navy Reserve. In 2016, Banks was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He was reelected in 2018, 2020, and 2022. In 2021, he voted to object to the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. After incumbent U.S. senator Mike Braun declined to run for reelection, Banks announced he would run in the 2024 election to replace him. After winning the Republican nomination unopposed, he defeated Democratic nominee Valerie McCray in the general election. == Early life and career == Banks was born on July 16, 1979, in Columbia City, Indiana. He graduated in 2004 from Indiana University Bloomington with a Bachelor of Arts in political science and later received a Master of Business Administration from Grace College & Seminary. Banks worked in the real estate and construction industry in Fort Wayne, Indiana, before serving in elected office. He serves in the United States Navy Reserve as a Supply Corps officer.

"John Cornyn III ( KOR-nin; born February 2, 1952) is an American politician, attorney, and former jurist serving as the senior United States senator for Texas, a seat he has held since 2002. He is a member of the Republican Party. Born in Houston, Cornyn is a graduate of Trinity University and St. Mary's University School of Law and received an LL.M. degree from the University of Virginia School of Law. He was a judge on Texas's 37th District Court from 1985 to 1991, when he was elected an associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court, where he served from until 1997. In 1998, Cornyn was elected Attorney General of Texas, serving one term before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002. He was reelected in 2008, 2014, and 2020. Cornyn chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee from 2009 to 2013 and served as the Senate majority whip for the 114th and 115th Congress. Often regarded as an institutional or moderate Republican, Cornyn has frequently played a role as a deal-maker and within the Senate. After the 2020 presidential election, he declined to join efforts by Republican lawmakers to challenge the certification of the election results and publicly criticized a Texas-led lawsuit seeking to overturn the outcome in several states. In 2022, Cornyn was the lead Republican negotiator for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant federal gun control legislation in decades. He has also supported bipartisan legislation reforming the Electoral Count Act and has said Congress should consider legislation addressing the legal status of DACA recipients as part of broader immigration discussions. Cornyn's votes and positions have drawn criticism from conservative activists and primary challengers in his 2026 re-election campaign. If reelected, Cornyn is set to become the dean of Texas's congressional delegation. == Early life, education, and legal career == Cornyn was born in Houston, the second child of Atholene Gale Cornyn (née Danley) and John Cornyn II, a colonel in the U.S. Air Force. He attended the American School in Japan after his family moved to Tokyo in 1968, and graduated from it in 1969. In 1973, he graduated from Trinity University, where he majored in journalism and was a member of Chi Delta Tau. Cornyn earned a Juris Doctor from St. Mary's University School of Law in 1977 and an LL.M. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1995. He was named the St. Mary's Distinguished Law School Graduate in 1994, and a Trinity University Distinguished Alumnus in 2001. In 1988, Cornyn attended a two-week seminar at Oxford University, jointly hosted by the National Judicial College at the University of Nevada, Reno and Florida State University’s College of Law.

"John Karl Fetterman ( FET-ər-mən; born August 15, 1969) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from Pennsylvania, a seat he has held since 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, he served from 2006 to 2019 as the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, and from 2019 to 2023 as the 34th lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. Fetterman studied finance at Albright College and earned an MBA from the University of Connecticut before beginning a professional career in the insurance industry. He went on to join AmeriCorps and earned an MPP from Harvard University. Fetterman's service with AmeriCorps led him to Braddock, where he moved in 2004 and was elected mayor the following year. As mayor, Fetterman sought to revitalize the former steel town through art and youth programs. Fetterman ran for the U.S. Senate in 2016, finishing third in the Democratic primary. He ran for lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania in 2018, defeating a field of candidates that included incumbent Mike Stack in the Democratic primary and winning the election with incumbent governor Tom Wolf. During his tenure, Fetterman received national attention for his efforts to legalize cannabis statewide, and for his opposition to President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud in Pennsylvania. In 2021, Fetterman announced his candidacy in the 2022 U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania. He won the Democratic nomination and defeated Republican nominee Mehmet Oz in the general election with 51% of the vote. In 2025, Fetterman became Pennsylvania's senior senator following the defeat of Bob Casey Jr. == Early life and education == Fetterman's ancestors were Pennsylvania Dutch. They emigrated from Germany and settled in Pennsylvania in the 17th century. Fetterman was born at Reading Hospital in West Reading, Pennsylvania, to Karl and Susan Fetterman, both of whom were 19 years old. Eventually they moved to York, Pennsylvania, where Fetterman grew up and his father became a partner at an insurance firm. He grew up in an affluent suburb of York, and his parents were conservative Republicans. Fetterman has said he had a privileged upbringing. He said he ""sleepwalked"" as a young adult while playing four years of football in college, intending eventually to take over ownership of his father's business. In 1991, Fetterman graduated from Albright College, also his father's alma mater, with a bachelor's in finance. He also received a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Connecticut (UConn) in 1993. For two years Fetterman worked in Pittsburgh as a risk-management underwriter for Chubb. While Fetterman was studying at UConn, his best friend died in a car accident. Following the tragedy, Fetterman joined Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, pairing with an eight-year-old boy in New Haven, Connecticut, whose father had died from AIDS and whose mother was slowly dying from the disease. During his time as a mentor, Fetterman says he became ""preoccupied with the concept of the random lottery of birth"", and promised the boy's mother he would continue to look out for her son after she was gone. After beginning a corporate career at Chubb, an insurance firm, Fetterman joined the recently founded AmeriCorps in 1995 and was sent to teach Pittsburgh students pursuing their GEDs. He later attended Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, graduating in 1999 with a Master of Public Policy degree.

A member of the Republican Party, Hoeven served as the 31st governor of North Dakota from 2000 to 2010. In 2010, Hoeven was elected to the U.S. Senate, succeeding Senator Byron Dorgan, who chose not to seek reelection. Hoeven became North Dakota's senior senator in 2013 after Kent Conrad retired and was succeeded by Heidi Heitkamp, who was once Hoeven's opponent for the governor's office. Before being elected governor, Hoeven was a banker who served in numerous executive roles at various banks, most notably as president of the nation's only state-owned bank, the Bank of North Dakota, from 1993 to 2000. He is on the board of directors at First Western Bank & Trust and has an estimated net worth of $45 million, making him one of the wealthiest U.S. senators. Hoeven has been the dean of North Dakota's congressional delegation since 2013, when Conrad retired. == Early life and education == Hoeven was born in Bismarck, North Dakota, the son of Patricia ""Trish"" (née Chapman) and John Henry ""Jack"" Hoeven, Jr. His father owned a bank in Minot, North Dakota, where he worked as the president and chairman. Hoeven's ancestry is Dutch, Swedish, and English. Hoeven studied at Dartmouth College, which his father also attended. Hoeven belonged to the Alpha Chi Alpha fraternity and graduated with honors with a B.A. in 1979. While there, he played on the men's golf team. After Dartmouth, Hoeven attended the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, graduating with an MBA in 1981. == Banking career == From 1986 to 1993, Hoeven was executive vice president of First Western Bank & Trust, an institution his father bought in 1970. At one time, he owned 39% of the bank’s parent company, Westbrand, Inc. From 1993 to 2000, he was the president and CEO of the Bank of North Dakota, under governor Ed Schafer. == Governor of North Dakota (2000-2010) == === Elections === ==== 2000 ==== In 2000 Hoeven ran for governor of North Dakota as a Republican and won, defeating Democratic NPL nominee Heidi Heitkamp, 55% to 45%. ==== 2004 ==== Hoeven was reelected over Democratic-NPL nominee Joe Satrom with 71% of the vote. ==== 2008 ==== On November 13, 2007, Hoeven announced his candidacy for a third term and kicked off his campaign with stops in Fargo, Grand Forks, Bismarck and Minot. He was reelected with 74% of the vote over Democratic-NPL nominee Tim Mathern. It was the first time in North Dakota history that a governor won three four-year terms in office, though the record for serving is still maintained by Bill Guy, who served 12 years. === Tenure === Hoeven's governorship included the expansion and diversification of the state's economy, which led to a 49.5% increase in the state's real gross domestic product. Beginning in 2000, he directed the development of a multi-resource energy program for the state with incentives in each energy sector, making North Dakota one of the country's largest energy-producing and exporting states. The state gained nearly 40,000 new jobs during his tenure. Wages and personal incomes grew faster than the national average.

"Joshua David Hawley (born December 31, 1979) is an American politician and attorney serving as the senior United States senator from Missouri, a seat he has held since 2019. A member of the Republican Party, Hawley served as the 42nd attorney general of Missouri from 2017 to 2019, before defeating two-term incumbent Democratic senator Claire McCaskill in the 2018 election. He was reelected in 2024. Born in Springdale, Arkansas, to a banker and a teacher, Hawley graduated from Stanford University in 2002 and Yale Law School in 2006. After being a law clerk to Judge Michael W. McConnell and Chief Justice John Roberts, he worked as a lawyer, first in private practice from 2008 to 2011 and then for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty from 2011 to 2015. Before being elected Missouri attorney general, he was also an associate professor at the University of Missouri School of Law, and a faculty member of the conservative Blackstone Legal Fellowship. As Missouri attorney general, Hawley initiated several high-profile lawsuits and investigations, including a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act, an investigation into Missouri governor Eric Greitens, and a lawsuit and investigation into companies associated with the opioid epidemic. His political beliefs have been described as populist and socially conservative. In December 2020, Hawley became the first senator to announce plans to object to the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 United States presidential election, and led efforts in the Senate to do so. == Early life and education == Joshua David Hawley was born on December 31, 1979, in Springdale, Arkansas, to banker Ronald Hawley and teacher Virginia Hawley. In 1981, the Hawleys moved to Lexington, Missouri, after Ronald joined a division of Boatmen's Bancshares there. Hawley attended Lexington Middle School and Rockhurst High School, a private Jesuit boys' prep school in Kansas City, Missouri. He graduated in 1998 as a valedictorian. According to his middle school principal, Barbara Weibling, several of Hawley's teachers thought ""he was probably going to be president one day."" While in high school, Hawley regularly wrote columns for his hometown newspaper, The Lexington News, about such topics as the American militia movement following the Oklahoma City bombing, media coverage of Los Angeles Police Department detective Mark Fuhrman, and affirmative action, which he opposed. Hawley studied history at Stanford University, where his mother was an alumna. He graduated in 2002 with a Bachelor of Arts degree with highest honors and Phi Beta Kappa membership. He studied under professor David M. Kennedy, who later contributed the foreword to Hawley's book Theodore Roosevelt: Preacher of Righteousness. Kennedy said Hawley stood out in a school ""which is overstuffed with overachieving and very talented young people"" and called him ""arguably the most gifted student I taught in 50 years"". In the summer of 2000, Hawley was an intern at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. After spending ten months in London teaching at St Paul's School from 2002 to 2003, Hawley returned to the U.S. to attend Yale Law School, graduating in 2006 with a Juris Doctor degree. The Kansas City Star reported that Hawley's classmates regarded him as ""politically ambitious and a deeply religious conservative"". At Yale, Hawley was articles editor of the Yale Law Journal, editor of the Yale Law & Policy Review, and president of",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,0qoz143zpttvpa6,,,Josh Hawley,senator,,250px_josh_hawley2c_official_portrait2c_116th_congress_28cropped29jpg_quu186sfiz.jpg,,,josh-hawley,Missouri,,,,,https://www.hawley.senate.gov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley,,

He later served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve while in Congress. He was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service in 2014 and held the rank of colonel. He did not see combat action during his service. Graham worked as a lawyer in private practice before serving in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1993 to 1995 and the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003, representing South Carolina's 3rd congressional district. In 2002, Graham was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was reelected in 2008, 2014, and 2020. A neoconservative, Graham is a war hawk and strong advocate for interventionist foreign policy. He has been known for his willingness to work with Democrats on issues such as immigration reform, judicial nominations, and cap and trade. He ran for the Republican nomination in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but dropped out before the primaries began. Graham was a critic of the Tea Party movement, particularly over taxation and immigration, and an outspoken critic of Donald Trump's 2016 candidacy. After a March 2017 meeting with Trump, Graham became a staunch ally of his, often issuing public statements in his defense and catching members of both parties by surprise. Commentators have noted that Graham’s public reconciliation with Trump coincided with his expanded influence on foreign policy, supporting military interventions, increased defense spending, and a more aggressive U.S. role abroad. He is running for re-election in 2026. == Early life == Lindsey Olin Graham was born in Central, South Carolina, where his parents, Millie (Walters) and Florence James ""F.J."" Graham, ran a restaurant/bar/pool hall/liquor store, the Sanitary Cafe. His family is of Scots-Irish descent. After graduating from D. W. Daniel High School, Graham became the first member of his family to attend college, and joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. When he was 21, his mother died of Hodgkin's lymphoma, aged 52, and his father died 15 months later of a heart attack, aged 69. Because his then-13-year-old sister was left orphaned, the service allowed Graham to attend the University of South Carolina in Columbia so he could remain near home as his sister's legal guardian. During his studies, he became a member of the Pi Kappa Phi social fraternity. He graduated from the University of South Carolina with a B.A. in psychology in 1977, and from the University of South Carolina School of Law with a J.D. in 1981. == Military service == Upon graduating from the University of South Carolina School of Law, Graham was commissioned as an officer in the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG Corps) in the United States Air Force in 1982 and began active duty that year. His duty began with a stint as an Air Force defense attorney, after which he was transferred to Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt,",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,5ltd29snemsv1ux,,,Lindsey Graham,senator,,250px_us_senator_lindsey_graham2c_official_photo2c_113th_congress_28cropped29jpg_neu5rag2j1.jpg,,,lindsey-graham,South Carolina,,,,,https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham,,

"Lisa Ann Murkowski ( mər-KOW-ski; born May 22, 1957) is an American attorney and politician serving as the senior United States senator from the state of Alaska, having held the seat since 2002. She is the first woman to represent Alaska in the U.S. Congress and is the Senate's second-most senior Republican woman. Murkowski became dean of Alaska's congressional delegation upon Representative Don Young's death. Murkowski is the daughter of former U.S. senator and governor of Alaska Frank Murkowski. She was appointed to the Senate by her father, who resigned his seat in 2002 to become Alaska's governor. Murkowski became the first Alaskan-born member of Congress and completed her father's unexpired Senate term, which ended in January 2005. Before her appointment to the Senate, she had been a member of the Alaska House of Representatives since 1999. Murkowski ran for and won a full term in 2004 with 48% of the vote. After losing the 2010 Republican primary to Tea Party candidate Joe Miller, she ran as a write-in candidate and defeated both Miller and Democrat Scott McAdams in the general election. Murkowski was reelected in 2016 and again in 2022. She was vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference from 2009 to 2010 and chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee from 2015 to 2021. She served as vice chair of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee from 2021 to 2025 and has served as chair of the committee since January 2025. Murkowski is often described as one of the Senate's most moderate Republicans and a swing vote. According to CQ Roll Call, she voted with President Barack Obama's position 72.3% of the time in 2013; she was one of only two Republicans to vote with Obama over 70% of the time. She opposed Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination in 2018 and supported Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court nomination in 2022. In 2021, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Donald Trump of incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial; the Alaska Republican Party censured her for that vote. Murkowski was a pivotal Republican vote for the first Trump administration's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the second Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. == Early life, education, and early career == Murkowski was born in Ketchikan in the Territory of Alaska, the daughter of Nancy Rena (née Gore) and Frank Murkowski. Her paternal great-grandfather was of Polish descent, and her mother's ancestry is Irish and French Canadian. As a child, she and her family moved around the state with her father's job as a banker. She earned a B.A. degree in economics from Georgetown University in 1980, the same year her father was elected to the U.S. Senate. She is a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority and represented Alaska as the 1980 Cherry Blossom Princess. She received her J.D. degree in 1985 from Willamette University College of Law. Murkowski subsequently failed the bar exam four times in a row, passing on her fifth attempt. Murkowski worked as an attorney in the Anchorage District Court Clerk's office from 1987 to 1989. From 1989 to 1998, she was an attorney in private practice in Anchorage.

"Maria Ellen Cantwell (; born October 13, 1958) is an American politician serving since 2001 as the junior U.S. senator from Washington. A member of the Democratic Party, she served from 1987 to 1993 in the Washington House of Representatives and from 1993 to 1995 in the United States House of Representatives. Born and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, Cantwell graduated from Miami University before moving to Seattle to work on Alan Cranston's 1984 presidential campaign. In 1986, she was elected to the state house of representatives, where she served until her election to Congress in 1992. Cantwell served one term in Congress before losing her seat to Republican Rick White in the 1994 election. She then briefly worked in the private sector as vice president of marketing for RealNetworks. Despite having vowed to remain out of politics, Cantwell ran for the United States Senate in 2000. She defeated Republican incumbent Slade Gorton in one of the closest elections in the state's history. Cantwell was reelected in 2006, 2012, 2018, and 2024. After Jeff Sessions resigned from the Senate in February 2017 to become United States Attorney General, Cantwell became the most senior junior senator.

Cantwell moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1983, to campaign for U.S. Senator Alan Cranston (D-CA) in his unsuccessful bid for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination. She then moved to the Seattle suburb of Mountlake Terrace, because it reminded her of Indianapolis, and led a successful campaign in 1986 to build a new library there.

"Mark Edward Kelly (born February 21, 1964) is an American politician and a retired astronaut and naval officer. He is the senior United States senator from Arizona, a seat he has held since 2020. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Kelly flew combat missions during the Gulf War as a naval aviator before being selected as a NASA Space Shuttle pilot in 1996. He flew his first space mission in 2001 as pilot of STS-108, then piloted STS-121 in 2006, and commanded STS-124 in 2008 and STS-134 (the final mission of Space Shuttle Endeavour) in 2011. In January 2011, Kelly's wife, then-Arizona Representative Gabby Giffords, was shot and nearly killed in an assassination attempt in Arizona. Kelly retired from the Navy and NASA that October. In 2013, Kelly and Giffords founded a nonprofit political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions (later merged into Giffords), which campaigned for gun control measures like universal background checks. Kelly was first elected to the Senate in a 2020 special election triggered by the death of Senator John McCain. He defeated incumbent Republican Martha McSally in the general election, becoming the first Democrat to win the seat since 1962. Kelly was reelected to a full term in 2022. Kelly was reportedly one of the three leading contenders for the Democratic vice presidential nomination in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, along with Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota governor Tim Walz. == Early life and education == Mark Kelly was born on February 21, 1964, in Orange, New Jersey, and raised in West Orange, New Jersey. He and his identical twin brother, Scott Kelly, are sons of Richard and Patricia (née McAvoy) Kelly, two retired police officers. Kelly is of Irish descent. Kelly graduated from Mountain High School in 1982. In 1986, he took highest honors in a marine engineering and nautical science BSc from the United States Merchant Marine Academy. In 1994, he received a MSc in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. == Naval career (1987–2011) == In December 1987, Kelly became a naval aviator and received initial training on the A-6E Intruder attack aircraft. He was then assigned to Attack Squadron 115 (VA-115) at NAF Atsugi in Kanagawa, Japan. He was deployed twice with VA-115 to the Persian Gulf aboard the aircraft carrier USS Midway, which was homeported at Naval Station Yokosuka in Yokosuka, Japan. During Operation Desert Storm, Kelly flew 39 combat missions. After the Gulf War, Kelly received his master's degree and then attended U.S. Naval Test Pilot School from 1993 to 1994. As a naval aviator and test pilot, he has logged over 5,000 hours in more than 50 different aircraft and trapped over 375 carrier landings. During his Navy career, Kelly received two Defense Superior Service Medals; one Legion of Merit; two Distinguished Flying Crosses; four Air Medals (two individual/two strike flight) with Combat ""V""; two Navy Commendation Medals, (one with combat ""V""); one Navy Achievement Medal; two Southwest Asia Service Medals; one Navy Expeditionary Medal; two Sea Service Deployment Ribbons; a NASA Distinguished Service Medal; and an Overseas Service Ribbon.

"Markwayne Mullin (born July 26, 1977) is an American and Cherokee politician and businessman serving since 2023 as the junior United States senator from Oklahoma. A member of the Republican Party, he was elected in a special election in 2022 to serve the remainder of Jim Inhofe's term. A member of the Cherokee Nation, Mullin is the first Native American U.S. senator since Ben Nighthorse Campbell retired in 2005. He is also the second Cherokee citizen elected to the Senate; the first, Robert Latham Owen, retired in 1925. From 2013 to 2023, Mullin served as the U.S. representative for Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district. == Early life, education, and businesses == Mullin was born on July 26, 1977, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the youngest of the seven children of Jim Martin Mullin and Brenda Gayle Morris Mullin, of Westville, Oklahoma. His first name is a tribute to two of his paternal uncles, Mark and Wayne; his mother put both names on his birth certificate, intending to later shorten his name to one of the two, but ultimately never did. He graduated from Stilwell High School in Stilwell, Oklahoma. He attended Missouri Valley College in 1996, but did not graduate. In 1997, at age 20, Mullin took over his father's business, Mullin Plumbing, when his father fell ill. In 2010, Mullin received an associate degree in construction technology from Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology. He is the only currently serving senator without at least a bachelor's degree. At the time he was first elected to Congress in 2012, Mullin hosted House Talk, a home improvement radio program syndicated across Oklahoma, on Tulsa station KFAQ. When elected to Congress, Mullin owned Mullin Properties, Mullin Farms, and Mullin Services, in addition to Mullin Plumbing. In 2012, he reported between $200,000 and $2 million in income from two family companies, and another $15,000 to $50,000 from shares he held in a bank. At the end of 2021, Mullin's reported assets increased to a range of $31.6 million to $75.6 million, compared to a range of $7.3 million to $29.9 million at the end of 2020. The increase was from the sale of his plumbing-related companies to HomeTown Services, a multi-state residential heating, air conditioning, plumbing and electrical company. Mullin said that the sale happened in early 2021, while Mullin was serving in the House of Representatives. == U.S. House of Representatives == === Elections === ==== 2012 ==== In June 2011, incumbent U.S. Representative Dan Boren announced that he would retire at the end of 2012 from his 2nd Congressional District seat. In September 2011, Mullin declared his candidacy for the seat. He branded himself as an outsider; his campaign slogan was ""A rancher. A businessman. Not a politician!"" In the six-candidate Republican primary, Mullin finished first with 42% of the vote; state representative George Faught ranked second with 23% of the vote. As a majority is required to win a congressional nomination in Oklahoma, a runoff was held; Mullin defeated Faught, 57%–43%. The district had historically been a ""Yellow Dog"" Democratic constituency, but had steadily trended Republican as Democrats lost ground with Southeast Oklahoma's rural whites. For this reason, Mullin was thought to have a good chance of winning the election. He defeated the Democratic nominee, former district attorney Rob Wallace, 57%–38%.

On November 6, 2018, Blackburn became the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Tennessee, defeating Democratic former Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen. Blackburn became the state's senior senator in January 2021 upon the retirement of Senator Lamar Alexander. Upon the retirement of Congressman Jim Cooper in 2023, she became the dean of Tennessee's congressional delegation. She won reelection to a second Senate term in 2024 against Democratic nominee Gloria Johnson. In August 2025, Blackburn announced her candidacy for governor of Tennessee in 2026. == Early life and education == Marsha Wedgeworth was born in Laurel, Mississippi, to Mary Jo (Morgan) and Hilman Wedgeworth, who worked in sales and management. She placed fourth during a beauty pageant in high school. Blackburn attended Mississippi State University on a 4-H scholarship, earning a Bachelor of Science in home economics in 1974. Blackburn was elected both as secretary and president of the Associated Women Students at Mississippi State University. == Early career and political activity == In 1973, before graduating from college, Blackburn worked as a sales manager for the Times Mirror Company. From 1975 to 1978, she worked in the Castner Knott Division of Mercantile Stores, Inc. In 1978, she became the owner of Marketing Strategies, a promotion-event management firm. As of 2016, Blackburn continued to run this business. Blackburn was a founding member of the Williamson County Young Republicans. She was chair of the Williamson County Republican Party from 1989 to 1991. In 1992, she ran for Congress in Tennessee's 6th congressional district, losing to incumbent Bart Gordon, and was a delegate to the 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1995, Blackburn was appointed executive director of the Tennessee Film, Entertainment, and Music Commission by Tennessee governor Don Sundquist, holding that post through 1997. Blackburn was a member of the Tennessee Senate from 1999 to 2003, and rose to be minority whip. In 2000, she took part in the effort to prevent the passage of a state income tax bill. == U.S. House of Representatives == Redistricting after the 2000 census moved Blackburn's home from the 6th district into the 7th district, and created a gerrymandered district that stretched for 200 miles from eastern Memphis to southwest Nashville. In 2002, Blackburn ran in the Republican primary for this congressional seat. Of the four main candidates, she was the only one from the Nashville suburbs. The other three (Mark Norris, David Kustoff, and Brent Taylor) were all from Memphis or its suburbs. Blackburn was endorsed by the conservative Club for Growth. The three Memphians split the vote in that area, and she won the primary by nearly 20 percentage points.

A member of the Republican Party, Crapo served from 1993 to 1999 as the U.S. representative for Idaho's 2nd congressional district. Born in Idaho Falls, Crapo is a graduate of Brigham Young University and Harvard Law School, practicing law in his home city throughout the 1980s. His brother Terry Crapo was majority leader in the Idaho House of Representatives from 1968 to 1972. Crapo was elected to the Idaho Senate in 1984, and served as Senate president pro tempore from 1988 to 1992. He was elected to the U.S. House in 1992, and served three terms before being elected to the Senate in 1998. He was reelected in 2004, 2010, 2016, and 2022. Crapo is the dean of Idaho's congressional delegation. == Early life and education == Crapo was born on May 20, 1951, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, to Melba (née Olsen) and George Crapo. He became an Eagle Scout in 1966. Crapo earned a Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, in political science from Brigham Young University in 1973 and a Juris Doctor, cum laude, from Harvard Law School in 1977. == Early political career == After graduating from law school, Crapo served for one year as a law clerk to Judge James M. Carter of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He then returned to Idaho to practice as a lawyer, joining his brother Terry Crapo's law firm of Holden Kidwell Hahn & Crapo in Idaho Falls. In the 1980s, he became active in the Republican Party's campaigns for seats in the state legislature. His brother served in Idaho House of Representatives for four years as majority leader (1968 to 1972) and was considered a rising star in Idaho politics. After Terry's death from leukemia in 1982, Mike ran for an open seat in the Idaho Senate. He was elected to the State Senate in 1984, where he served until 1992. In 1988, Senate President pro tempore Jim Risch unexpectedly lost reelection to the Idaho Senate, and Crapo was elected by his colleagues to the president's position. He served as senate president pro tempore from 1988 to 1992. On January 27, 1989, Crapo served as acting governor of Idaho for 12 hours while Governor Cecil D. Andrus was out of the state testifying before Congress and Lieutenant Governor Butch Otter was out of the state on business for his employer, Simplot. Andrus, a Democrat, left Crapo a note saying, ""Don't do anything I wouldn't do. ... P.S. The chair is comfortable, isn't it?"" Crapo was elected to Congress in 1992, representing Idaho's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. He served three terms from 1993 to 1999. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998. == U.S. Senate == === Elections === Crapo was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998. He succeeded fellow Republican Dirk Kempthorne, who retired after one term to run for governor.

"Michael Shumway Lee (born June 4, 1971) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the senior United States senator from Utah, a seat he has held since 2011. A member of the Republican Party, Lee became Utah's senior senator in 2019, when Orrin Hatch retired, and the dean of Utah's congressional delegation in 2021, when Representative Rob Bishop retired. The son of U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee and brother of Utah Supreme Court justice Thomas Rex Lee, Lee began his career as a clerk for the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah before clerking for Samuel Alito, who was then a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. From 2002 to 2005, Lee was an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Utah. He joined the administration of Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr., serving as the general counsel in the governor's office from 2005 to 2006. Lee again clerked for Alito after he was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Utah, Lee defeated incumbent senator Bob Bennett in the Republican primary and won the general election. Although he refused to endorse Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries and voted for Evan McMullin in the general election, Lee eventually became a Trump ally. He endorsed Trump in the 2020 and 2024 elections and supported the Trump administration's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, although he did not sign the Texas v. Pennsylvania amicus brief, and ultimately voted to certify the outcome. Lee has been reelected twice, in 2016 and 2022, the latter victory over McMullin. Lee also chaired the Joint Economic Committee from 2019 to 2021. == Early life and education == Lee was born in Mesa, Arizona on June 4, 1971, the son of Janet (née Griffin) and Rex E. Lee, who was solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan. Lee's older brother, Thomas Rex Lee, is a former justice of the Utah Supreme Court. Lee's family moved to Provo, Utah, one year later, when his father became the founding dean of Brigham Young University's J. Reuben Clark Law School. While Lee spent about half of his childhood years in Utah, he spent the other half in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. His father served first as the assistant U.S. attorney general for the civil division of the U.S. Department of Justice from 1975 to 1976, and then as the solicitor general of the United States from 1981 to 1985. Lee is of English, Swiss, and Danish descent. After graduating from Timpview High School in 1989, Lee attended Brigham Young University. He was elected president of the students' association, BYUSA, while his father was president of the university. He graduated in 1994 with a bachelor of arts in political science. Lee then attended BYU's J. Reuben Clark Law School, where he was a member of the BYU Law Review and graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1997. == Legal career == After law school, Lee clerked for Judge Dee Benson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah from 1997 to 1998, then for Judge (later Supreme Court Justice) Samuel Alito of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1998 to 1999.

"Marion Michael Rounds (born October 24, 1954) is an American businessman and politician serving as the junior United States senator from South Dakota since 2015. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 31st governor of South Dakota from 2003 to 2011. Rounds was raised in Pierre, South Dakota. He attended South Dakota State University, where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree. He was elected to the South Dakota Senate in 1990, representing the 24th district until 2001. Rounds ran for governor of South Dakota in 2002, and after an upset victory in the Republican primary, won the general election. He was reelected in 2006. In 2014, Rounds was elected to the United States Senate, succeeding retiring Democrat Tim Johnson. He was reelected in 2020. == Early life, education, and business career == The eldest of 11 children, Rounds was born in Huron, South Dakota, the son of Joyce (née Reinartz) and Don Rounds. He has German, Belgian, Swedish and English ancestry. Rounds has lived in the state capital of Pierre since he was three years old. He was named for an uncle, Marion Rounds, who was killed in the Pacific theater during World War II. Several members of the Rounds family have been involved in state government. His father worked at various times as state director of highway safety, a staffer for the Rural Electrification Administration, and executive director of the South Dakota Petroleum Council. His brother Tim Rounds was a member of the South Dakota House of Representatives, representing District 24, which includes Pierre, from 2003 to 2011 and from 2013 to 2021. Rounds attended South Dakota State University in Brookings, where he earned his Bachelor of Science in political science. Rounds is a former partner in Fischer Rounds & Associates, an insurance and real estate firm with offices in Pierre, Rapid City, Mitchell, Watertown and Sioux Falls. == South Dakota Senate == === Elections === Rounds represented District 24, which was based in Pierre. In 1990, he defeated incumbent state Senator Jacqueline Kelley, 53%–47%. He was reelected in 1992 (60%), 1994 (77%), 1996 (66%), and 1998 (75%). Rounds had to leave the Senate in 2001 because of legislative term limits South Dakota voters had passed in 1992. === Tenure === Rounds represented Hughes, Lyman, Stanley, and Sully counties. In 1993, he became Senate Minority Whip. In 1995, his peers selected him to be Senate Majority Leader. === Committee assignments === Commerce Education Legislative Procedure Local Government Retirement Laws State Affairs Taxation == Governor of South Dakota == === Elections === ==== 2002 ==== As the 2002 race for governor took shape, media and political observers largely dismissed Rounds as an extreme long shot. Until late 2001, then-Congressman John Thune was the front-runner for the nomination. When Thune passed on the race to challenge Senator Tim Johnson, state Attorney General Mark Barnett and former Lieutenant Governor Steve T. Kirby became candidates. Rounds benefited from the heated competition between Kirby and Barnett, much of which centered on ethical concerns about Kirby's personal business investments and damaged both candidates' reputations, with Barnett's campaign advertisements involving claims ""so outlandish that people thought for sure that they were exaggerated or completely fabricated"". By staying above the fray, Rounds won the primary by 15 points. After winning the Republican nomination,",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,8mszrmavbmmby0n,,,Mike Rounds,senator,,250px_mike_rounds_official_senate_portrait_28cropped29jpg_ogm2pibx7i.jpg,,,mike-rounds,South Dakota,,,,,https://www.rounds.senate.gov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rounds,,

"Addison Mitchell McConnell III ( mə-KON-əl; born February 20, 1942) is an American politician and attorney serving as the senior United States senator from Kentucky, a seat he has held since 1985. McConnell is in his seventh Senate term and is the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. He served from 2007 to 2025 as the leader of the Senate Republican Conference, including two stints as minority leader (2007 to 2015 and 2021 to 2025), and was majority leader from 2015 to 2021, making him the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history. McConnell holds conservative political positions, although he was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican early in his political career. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the U.S. Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. FEC, which partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives during the Obama administration, making frequent use of the filibuster, and blocked many of President Barack Obama's judicial nominees, including Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. During the first Trump administration, the Senate Republican majority under McConnell's leadership passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018, the First Step Act, and the Great American Outdoors Act, and confirmed a record number of federal appeals court judges during a president's first two years. McConnell invoked the nuclear option to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, after his predecessor Harry Reid had eliminated the filibuster for all other presidential nominations; Trump subsequently won Supreme Court confirmation battles over Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. While supportive of most of Trump's domestic and foreign policies, McConnell criticized Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and despite voting to acquit in Trump's second impeachment trial for reasons related to the constitutionality of impeaching a former president, deemed him ""practically and morally responsible"" for the January 6 United States Capitol attack. In late 2024, McConnell wrote an essay on his current view of American power and the foreign policy mistakes of former presidents. In 2015, 2019 and 2023, Time listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. On February 28, 2024, McConnell announced that he would step down as the Senate Republican Conference Leader in January 2025, but would serve the remainder of his Senate term. An internal election to fill the post of Senate Republican Leader was held on November 13, in which South Dakota senator John Thune was selected. On February 20, 2025, McConnell announced he would not run for an eighth Senate term in 2026 and would retire from politics. This came after increasing concerns about his health and ability to continue serving. == Early life and education (1942–1967) == McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene ""Dean"" (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell ""A.M."" McConnell II at Colbert County Hospital (now Helen Keller Hospital) in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home. He is of Scots-Irish and English descent. His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,ox4gerljyjqevgq,,,Mitch McConnell,senator,,250px_mitch_mcconnell_portrait_2016jpg_wsc9alfqen.jpg,,,mitch-mcconnell,Kentucky,,,,,https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch%20McConnell,,

"Patricia Lynn Murray (née Johns; born October 11, 1950) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from Washington, a seat she has held since 1993. A member of the Democratic Party, she held the position of president pro tempore of the Senate from 2023 to 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, Murray served in the Washington State Senate from 1989 to 1993. She was Washington's first female U.S. senator and is the first woman in American history to hold the position of president pro tempore. Murray is also the youngest senator to occupy the office of president pro tempore in more than five decades. Born and raised in Bothell, Washington, Murray graduated from Washington State University with a degree in physical education. She worked as a preschool teacher and later as a parenting teacher at Shoreline Community College. A long-time advocate for environmental and education issues, Murray was elected to serve on her local school board in King County. One of her early elected political mentors was Donn Charnley. She ran for the Washington State Senate in 1988, and defeated two-term incumbent Bill Kiskaddon. She served one term before launching a campaign for the United States Senate in 1992. She has been re-elected five times, most recently in 2022. As a senator, Murray has been a part of party leadership since 2001, having served as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Conference secretary, and assistant Democratic leader. She currently chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. Before assuming her current roles, Murray has previously chaired at various times, the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Murray garnered national attention in 2013, when Republican representative Paul Ryan and she announced that they had negotiated a two-year, bipartisan budget, known as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Murray is currently the third-most senior senator, the most senior Senate Democrat, the longest-serving female senator ever, and the dean of Washington's congressional delegation since 2017 upon Representative Jim McDermott's retirement. == Early life and education == One of seven children, Murray was born in Bothell, Washington, a daughter of David L. Johns and Beverly A. McLaughlin. Her mother was an accountant. Her father served in World War II and was awarded a Purple Heart. Her ancestry includes Welsh, Irish, Scottish, and French-Canadian. When she was a teenager, her family was forced to apply for welfare assistance when her father became disabled due to multiple sclerosis. He had been the manager of a five-and-ten store. Murray attended Saint Brendan Catholic School as a young child. Murray received a bachelor of arts degree in physical education from Washington State University in 1972. == Early career == Murray was a preschool teacher for several years and taught a parenting class at Shoreline Community College from 1984 to 1987. As a citizen-lobbyist for environmental and educational issues, Murray has said that a state representative once told her she could not make a difference because she was just a ""mom in tennis shoes"". The phrase stuck, and she later used it in her successful campaigns for the Shoreline School District board of directors (1985–89), Washington State Senate (1989–93), and United States Senate (1993–present). Murray was successful in gathering grassroots support to strike down proposed preschool program",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,wyowbouof66obqc,,,Patty Murray,senator,,250px_patty_murray2c_official_portrait2c_113th_congress_28cropped29jpg_7uie12xqul.jpg,,,patty-murray,Washington,,,,,https://www.murray.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray,,

"Randal Howard Paul (born January 7, 1963) is an American politician serving as the junior United States senator from Kentucky since 2011. A member of the Republican Party, he is the chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Paul has described himself as a constitutional conservative and a supporter of the Tea Party movement. His libertarian views have been compared to those of his father, three-time presidential candidate and 12-term U.S. representative from Texas, Ron Paul. Paul attended Baylor University and is a graduate of the Duke University School of Medicine. He was a practicing ophthalmologist in Bowling Green, Kentucky, from 1993 until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2010. He was re-elected in 2016 and won a third term in 2022. Paul was a candidate for the Republican nomination in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. == Early life == Randal Howard Paul was born on January 7, 1963, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Carol (née Wells) and Ron Paul, who is also a politician and physician. The middle child of five, his siblings are Ronald ""Ronnie"" Paul Jr., Lori Paul Pyeatt, Robert Paul, and Joy Paul LeBlanc. Paul was baptized in the Episcopal Church and identified as a practicing Christian as a teenager. Despite his father's libertarian views and strong support for individual rights, the novelist Ayn Rand was not the inspiration for his first name. Growing up, he went by ""Randy"", but his wife shortened it to ""Rand"". The Paul family moved to Lake Jackson, Texas, in 1968, where he was raised and where his father began a medical practice and for a period of time was the only obstetrician in Brazoria County. When Rand was 13, his father Ron Paul was elected to the United States House of Representatives. That same year, Paul attended the 1976 Republican National Convention, where his father headed Ronald Reagan's Texas delegation. The younger Paul spent several summer vacations interning in his father's congressional office. In his teenage years, Paul studied the Austrian economists that his father respected, as well as the writings of Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand. Paul went to Brazoswood High School and was on the swimming team and played defensive back on the football team. Paul attended Baylor University from fall 1981 to summer 1984 and was enrolled in the honors program. During the time he spent at Baylor, he completed his pre-med requirements in two and a half years, was involved in the swim team and the Young Conservatives of Texas and was a member of a tongue-in-cheek secret organization, the NoZe Brotherhood, known for its irreverent humor. He regularly contributed to The Baylor Lariat student newspaper. Paul left Baylor without completing his baccalaureate degree, when he was accepted into his father's alma mater, the Duke University School of Medicine, which, at the time, did not require an undergraduate degree for admission to its graduate school. He earned a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1988 and completed his residency in 1993. == Medical career == After completing his residency at Duke University in ophthalmology, Paul moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where he has been practicing since 1993. He worked for Downing McPeak Vision Centers for five years. In 1998, he joined a private medical group practice, the Graves Gilbert Clinic, in Bowling Green, for",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,vzuu9gb1qc2wop8,,,Rand Paul,senator,,250px_rand_paul_official_portrait_28cropped29jpg_rz8drkw692.jpg,,,rand-paul,Kentucky,,,,,https://www.paul.senate.gov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand%20Paul,,

In 1987, after serving in the U.S. Navy and becoming a law firm partner, he co-founded Columbia Hospital Corporation. Columbia later merged with another corporation to form Columbia/HCA, which eventually became the nation's largest for-profit health care company. Scott was pressured to resign as chief executive of Columbia/HCA in 1997. During his tenure as chief executive, the company defrauded Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs. The U.S. Department of Justice won 14 felony convictions against the company, which was fined $1.7 billion in what was at the time the largest healthcare fraud settlement in U.S. history. Following his departure from Columbia/HCA, Scott became a venture capitalist and pursued other business interests. Scott ran for governor of Florida in 2010, defeating Bill McCollum in a vigorously contested Republican primary election and Democratic nominee Alex Sink by just over one point in the general election. Scott was reelected in 2014, again by just over one point, against former governor Charlie Crist. He was barred by term limits from running for reelection in 2018, and instead ran for the U.S. Senate. Scott won the 2018 U.S. Senate election, defeating incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson in a close election that triggered a mandatory recount. He was reelected in 2024, defeating Democratic nominee Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by over 12 points. He became Florida's senior senator in 2025, when Marco Rubio resigned to become Secretary of State. == Early life and education == Rick Scott was born Richard Lynn Myers in Bloomington, Illinois, on December 1, 1952. Scott never met his biological father, Gordon William Myers, whom Scott's mother, Esther J. Scott, described as an abusive alcoholic. Scott's parents divorced in his infancy. In 1954, Esther married Orba George Scott Jr. (died 2006), a truck driver. Orba adopted Rick, who took his stepfather's surname and became known as Richard Lynn Scott. Scott was raised in North Kansas City, Missouri, the second of five children. His family was lower-middle-class and struggled financially; Esther Scott worked as a clerk at J. C. Penney, among other jobs. Scott graduated from North Kansas City High School in 1970. He attended community college for a year, and then enlisted in the United States Navy. In 1972, he married Ann Holland, whom he met in high school, at a Baptist church in Kansas City. Scott had completed naval bootcamp just before the wedding. Afterward, he was sent to a naval posting in Newport, Rhode Island, where he and his wife lived for 15 months. He served there as a radarman on the USS Glover (FF-1098), which during his enlistment spent time dry docked in Boston and sailed to ports in Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Scott was in the Navy for 29 months, including training. After the Navy, Scott and his wife moved to Kansas City, where he attended college on the G.I. Bill. He graduated in 1975 from the University of Missouri–Kansas",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,bgtzd0phq5slxvk,,,Rick Scott,senator,,250px_official_portrait_of_senator_rick_scott_28cropped29jpg_49xs0f2rgt.jpg,,,rick-scott,Florida,,,,,https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott,,

"Roger Wayne Marshall (born August 9, 1960) is an American politician, physician, and former military officer serving as the junior United States senator from Kansas since 2021. A member of the Republican Party, he served from 2017 to 2021 as the U.S. representative for Kansas's 1st congressional district, a mostly rural district covering much of the western and northern parts of the state. An obstetrician, Marshall was first elected to Congress in 2016, defeating incumbent Tim Huelskamp in the Republican primary for Kansas's 1st congressional district. On September 7, 2019, he announced his bid for the United States Senate in the 2020 election; he sought the seat being vacated by Pat Roberts. Marshall won the August 4 Republican primary and was elected on November 3, defeating Democratic nominee Barbara Bollier. Marshall was sworn in on January 3, 2021. On January 6, 2021, Marshall joined a group of Republican senators led by Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz in support of the objections to Pennsylvania's and Arizona's electoral votes, both of which were rejected by the Senate, 92-7 and 93-6 respectively. Marshall serves on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, & Forestry; Finance; Budget; and Health, Education, Labor, & Pensions Committees. == Early life and education == Marshall was born in El Dorado, Kansas. He attended Butler Community College before attending Kansas State University, where he received a Bachelor of Science in biochemistry and was a member of Beta Theta Pi. He received his Doctor of Medicine from the University of Kansas. He completed a residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. Marshall has served as chairman of the board of Great Bend Regional Hospital and vice president of the Farmers Bank and Trust, and has been a district governor of Rotary International. He also served seven years in the United States Army Reserve, reaching the rank of captain. == U.S. House of Representatives == === 2016 campaign === Marshall ran against incumbent Tim Huelskamp in the Republican Party primary election for Kansas's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. He had the support of many of Kansas's agricultural groups, who were angry that Huelskamp lost his seat on the House Agriculture Committee, the first time in a century that no Kansan was on that panel. During the primary, Huelskamp's campaign ran TV ads criticizing Marshall for a confrontation with a neighbor in 2008 in connection with a land dispute; the neighbor made a 9-1-1 call accusing Marshall of attempting to run him over with a vehicle. Marshall ultimately pleaded no contest to a reckless driving misdemeanor and settled the neighbor's civil suit. On August 2, Marshall defeated Huelskamp in the Republican primary, 56% to 44%. No Democrat filed to run in the heavily Republican district. In the general election, Marshall won handily, defeating independent candidate Alan LaPolice and Libertarian Kerry Burt with 65.9% of the vote. Marshall was endorsed by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Kansas Livestock Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, and the Kansas Farm Bureau, an affiliate of the American Farm Bureau Federation. Marshall represented a district that had long been nicknamed ""the Big First"" because it covered all or part of 63 counties in central and western Kansas, more than half the state's land mass.

"Ronald Harold Johnson (born April 8, 1955) is an American businessman and politician serving as the senior United States senator from Wisconsin, a seat he has held since 2011. A Republican, Johnson was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, defeating Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold. He was reelected in 2016, defeating Feingold in a rematch, and in 2022, narrowly defeating Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes. Born in Mankato, Minnesota, Johnson attended high school in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of the Twin Cities, and received a degree from the University of Minnesota. Before entering politics, he was chief executive officer of a polyester and plastics manufacturer in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, founded by his brother-in-law. A staunch ally of President Donald Trump, Johnson voted for Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, supported Trump's decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), launched investigations into his political opponents and promoted false claims of fraud in relation to Trump's defeat in the 2020 presidential election. He has rejected the scientific consensus on climate change. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson voted for the CARES Act, resisted stay at home orders, used his chairmanship of the Senate Homeland Security Committee to invite witnesses who promoted fringe theories about COVID-19 and spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccinations. He has also suggested Social Security and Medicare spending be subject to an annual congressional vote. == Early life and education == Johnson was born in Mankato, Minnesota, the son of Jeanette Elizabeth (née Thisius) and Dale Robert Johnson. His father was of Norwegian descent and his mother of German ancestry. Growing up, Johnson delivered newspapers, worked as a caddy at a golf course, baled hay on his uncle's dairy farm, and worked as a dishwasher in a restaurant. He attended Edina High School but skipped his senior year and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1977 with a bachelor's degree in business and accounting. He continued his studies but did not receive a graduate degree. == Business career == In 1979, Johnson moved to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, with his wife, Jane. He worked for his wife's family's plastics company, PACUR, an abbreviation of ""Pat Curler"", Jane's brother. Curler created the company with funding from his and Jane's father, Howard Curler. Howard Curler had been named CEO of the plastics giant Bemis Company in 1978, and for the first several years of PACUR's existence, Bemis was the company's only customer. According to his campaign biography, Johnson worked as PACUR's accountant and a machine operator. The company later expanded into specialty plastics used in medical device packaging, which involved hiring salespeople and exporting products to other countries. In the mid-1980s, Pat Curler left PACUR and Johnson became its CEO. In 1987, the Curler family sold PACUR to Bowater Industries for $18 million; Johnson remained the company's CEO. In 1997, he purchased PACUR from Bowater; he remained CEO until he was elected to the Senate in 2010. == U.S. Senate == === Elections === ==== 2010 ==== The 2010 U.S. Senate campaign was Johnson's first run for elected office. According to The New York Times, Johnson said he ""did kind of spring out of the Tea Party"" and is glad to be associated with it, although he did not join the Senate Tea Party Caucus following his election.

"Ronald Lee Wyden ( WY-dən; born May 3, 1949) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from Oregon, a seat he has held since 1996. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in the United States House of Representatives from 1981 until 1996. Upon the death of Representative Don Young in 2022, Wyden became the dean of the West Coast's Congressional delegation. He is the dean of Oregon's congressional delegation and serves as the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. Known for his libertarian-leaning stances within the Democratic Party, Wyden has been a prominent advocate for privacy rights, internet freedom, and limiting government surveillance, positioning him as a defender of civil liberties. == Early life, education, and early career == Ronald Wyden was born in Wichita, Kansas, the son of Edith (née Rosenow) and Peter H. Wyden (originally Weidenreich, 1923–1998), both of whom were Jewish and had fled Nazi Germany. He grew up in Palo Alto, California, where he played basketball for Palo Alto High School. He attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, on a basketball scholarship, and later transferred to Stanford University, where he majored in political science and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He received a Juris Doctor from the University of Oregon School of Law in 1974, but has never been a member of the Oregon State Bar. While teaching gerontology at several Oregon universities, Wyden founded the Oregon chapter of the Gray Panthers, which he led from 1974 to 1980. He was also the director of the Oregon Legal Services Center for Elderly, a nonprofit law service. From 1977 to 1979 he served on the Oregon State Board of Examiners of Nursing Home Administrators. == U.S. House of Representatives == Wyden ran for the United States House of Representatives in 1980. In the Democratic primary, Wyden, who was just 31 at the time, upset incumbent Representative Bob Duncan in Oregon's 3rd congressional district, which includes most of Portland. Later that fall, Wyden defeated his Republican opponent, Darrell Conger, with 71% of the vote. The 3rd has long been the most Democratic district in Oregon, and Wyden was reelected seven times, never with less than 70% of the vote. In the House, Wyden played an influential role in the passage of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. == U.S. Senate == === Elections === ==== 1996 Special ==== In January 1996, in a special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Bob Packwood, Wyden defeated Oregon State Senate President Gordon Smith by just over 18,000 votes, mainly due to swamping Smith by over 89,000 votes in Multnomah County. Smith won the regular Senate election that November to succeed the retiring Mark Hatfield, and Smith and Wyden served together until Smith's defeat in 2008 by Democrat Jeff Merkley. Wyden holds the Senate seat that was once held by Wayne Morse, a man whom Wyden worked for in the summer of 1968 as Morse's driver, and whom Wyden calls his mentor. ==== 1998 ==== Wyden was elected to a full term in 1998 with 61% of the vote. ==== 2004 ==== Wyden was reelected in 2004 with 64% of the vote to Republican nominee Al King's 31%. ==== 2010 ==== In 2010, Wyden was reelected with",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,bwj3jsv4gsq2occ,,,Ron Wyden,senator,,ron_wyden_d8w1h7sy0c.jpg,,,ron-wyden,Oregon,,,,,https://www.wyden.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden,,

"Sheldon Whitehouse (born October 20, 1955) is an American politician and attorney serving as the junior United States senator from Rhode Island, a seat he has held since 2007. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the United States Attorney for the District of Rhode Island from 1993 to 1998, and as the 71st attorney general of Rhode Island from 1999 to 2003. He was elected to the Senate in 2006, defeating Republican incumbent Lincoln Chafee. He was reelected in 2012, 2018, and 2024. A political progressive and climate hawk, Whitehouse became chair of the United States Senate Committee on the Budget in 2023. He has given hundreds of Senate floor speeches about climate change and asserted that politically conservative ""dark money"" groups are conducting a campaign to take control of the U.S. government, specifically the Supreme Court of the United States, to prevent climate action, among other reasons. == Early life and education == Whitehouse was born on October 20, 1955, in New York City, the son of Mary Celine (née Rand) and career diplomat Charles Sheldon Whitehouse, and grandson of diplomat Edwin Sheldon Whitehouse (1883–1965). Whitehouse's father served as the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand and Laos. Among his great-great-grandfathers were Episcopal bishop Henry John Whitehouse and railroad executive Charles Crocker, who was among the founders of the Central Pacific Railroad. Whitehouse graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and in 1978 from Yale College. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1982. == Early career == Whitehouse worked as a clerk for Justice Richard Neely of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia from 1982 to 1983. He also worked in the Rhode Island Attorney General's office as a special assistant attorney general from 1985 to 1990, chief of the Regulatory Unit (which oversaw utilities) from 1988 to 1990, and as an assistant attorney general from 1989 to 1990. Whitehouse worked as Rhode Island Governor Bruce Sundlun's executive counsel beginning in 1991, and was later tapped to serve as director of policy. He oversaw the state's response to the Rhode Island banking crisis that took place soon after Sundlun took office. In 1992, Sundlun appointed Whitehouse the state's Director of Business Regulation, where he oversaw the state's workers' compensation insurance system. == Early political career == === U.S. attorney === President Bill Clinton appointed Whitehouse United States Attorney for Rhode Island in 1994. Whitehouse held the position for four years. With the 1996 extortion conviction of mobster Gerard Ouimette, he was the first prosecutor to convict a member of organized crime under Clinton's ""three-strikes law"". Ouimette was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. === State attorney general === In 1998, Whitehouse was elected Rhode Island Attorney General. He initiated a lawsuit against the lead paint industry that ended in a mistrial; the state later won a second lawsuit against former lead paint manufacturers Sherwin-Williams, Millennium Holdings, and NL Industries that found them responsible for creating a public nuisance. This decision, however, was unanimously overturned by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on July 1, 2008. The court found that under Rhode Island law it is the responsibility of property owners to abate and mitigate lead hazards.

"Steven David Daines ( DAYNZ; born August 20, 1962) is an American politician and former corporate executive serving as the senior United States senator from Montana, a seat he has held since 2015. He is the first Republican Class II senator from Montana in 102 years. Daines represented Montana's at-large congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2013 to 2015. Daines was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Bozeman, Montana. Before entering politics, he held positions at Procter & Gamble and the Montana-based software service RightNow Technologies. After an unsuccessful lieutenant governor's race in 2008, Daines was elected to represent Montana's at-large congressional district in Congress in 2012. He was first elected to the Senate in 2014, becoming the first Republican to win a U.S. Senate seat in Montana in the 21st century. He was reelected in 2020, defeating the Democratic nominee, incumbent governor Steve Bullock. In 2023, Daines became chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, succeeding Rick Scott. Republicans gained four Senate seats in the 2024 election cycle and won a majority in the chamber. Daines became Montana's senior senator and dean of Montana's congressional delegation in 2025, following the defeat of Jon Tester in his reelection. == Early life and education == Daines was born in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles to Sharon R. and Clair W. Daines. The family moved to Montana in 1964. He was raised in Bozeman, where he attended school from kindergarten through college. Daines graduated from Bozeman High School, where he served as student body president and participated in policy debate; his partner was future U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from Montana State University. At Montana State, he became a brother of the Sigma Nu fraternity. == Early career == Daines was one of the youngest delegates at the 1984 Republican National Convention. ""I was a big fan of Ronald Reagan. He was the first president I got to vote for,"" he has said. Daines was also the president of MSU College Republicans. In 2007, he and his wife started a website, GiveItBack.com, which urged governor Brian Schweitzer to return the state's $1 billion surplus to taxpayers. From 2007 to 2008, he was Montana state chairman for the Mike Huckabee 2008 presidential campaign and a national surrogate for Huckabee. Daines spent 13 years with Procter & Gamble. After seven years managing operations in the United States, he and his family moved to Hong Kong and China for six years, opening factories to expand Procter & Gamble's Asian business. During his 2014 Senate campaign, Democratic opponents alleged that Daines had outsourced U.S. jobs to China. He stated that he created hundreds of jobs in Montana when he worked for RightNow Technologies. In 1997, Daines left Procter & Gamble to join the family construction business in Bozeman. Three years later, he met Greg Gianforte, founder of RightNow Technologies, and was put in charge of running RightNow's customer care division. Daines went on to become vice president of North America Sales and vice president of the Asia-Pacific division. During his tenure, the cloud-based software company became publicly traded and Bozeman's largest commercial employer. Daines remained with the company until March 2012, when he left to campaign for Congress",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,ipynt0dc9u2ge8t,,,Steve Daines,senator,,250px_steve_daines2c_official_portrait2c_116th_congress_28cropped29jpg_w3sij4iohx.jpg,,,steve-daines,Montana,,,,,https://www.daines.senate.gov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Daines,,

"Ladda Tammy Duckworth (born March 12, 1968) is an American politician and Army National Guard veteran serving as the junior United States senator from Illinois, a seat she has held since 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, she represented Illinois's 8th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2013 to 2017. Born in Bangkok, Thailand, and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Duckworth was educated at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and George Washington University. She joined the United States Army Reserve in 1992, and served as a United States Army helicopter pilot in the Iraq War. In 2004, when her Black Hawk helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Iraqi insurgents, she lost both legs and some mobility in her right arm. She was the first female double amputee from the war. Despite her injuries, she was awarded a medical waiver to continue serving in the Illinois Army National Guard for another ten years until she retired as a lieutenant colonel in 2014. Duckworth ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006, then served as director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs from 2006 to 2009 and as assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from 2009 to 2011. In 2012, Duckworth was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she served two terms. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016, defeating Republican incumbent Mark Kirk. Duckworth is the first Thai American woman elected to Congress, the first person born in Thailand elected to Congress, the first woman with a disability elected to Congress, the first female double amputee in the Senate, and the first senator to give birth while in office. She is the second Asian American woman to serve in the Senate, after Mazie Hirono. Duckworth serves on the Senate Armed Services; Commerce, Science, & Transportation; Foreign Relations; and Veterans' Affairs Committees. == Early life and education == Ladda Tammy Duckworth was born on March 12, 1968, in Bangkok, Thailand, to an American father, Franklin Duckworth, and a Thai mother, Lamai Sompornpairin. Her father, who died in 2005, was a veteran of the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps who traced his family's roots to the American Revolution. Duckworth is also descended from Henry Coe, her 6th-great grandfather, who enslaved four people mentioned in freedom clauses of his 1827 will; according to Duckworth, although ""gut wrenching"" . . . ""it's a disservice to our nation and our history to walk away from this [fact]. If I am going to claim—and be proud that—I am a Daughter of the American Revolution, then I have to acknowledge that I am also a daughter of people who enslaved other people"". Her mother is Thai Chinese, originally from Chiang Mai. Her father was a Baptist, who after his military service worked with the United Nations and international companies in refugee, housing, and development programs. As the family moved around Southeast Asia for her father's work, Duckworth became fluent in Thai and Indonesian, in addition to English. Duckworth attended schools outside the U.S. but based on a standard American curriculum: Singapore American School, the International School Bangkok, and the Jakarta International School.

"Theodore Paul Budd (born October 21, 1971) is an American businessman and politician serving since 2023 as the junior United States senator for North Carolina. A member of the Republican Party, he was the U.S. representative for North Carolina's 13th congressional district from 2017 to 2023. Budd was the Republican nominee in the 2022 United States Senate election in North Carolina to replace retiring Republican senator Richard Burr. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Cheri Beasley, and took office on January 3, 2023. == Early life and career == Budd was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1971. When he was young, his family moved to a 300-acre (120 ha) farm on the Yadkin River in Davie County, outside Advance, where they raise cattle and chickens. His father, Richard, owned a facility-services company. Budd attended Summit School, a private school in Winston-Salem, before attending Davie County High School, graduating in 1990. He then attended Appalachian State University, where received a Bachelor of Science in business administration in 1994. Budd later received a master of theology from the Dallas Theological Seminary in 1998 and a master of business administration from the Wake Forest University School of Business in 2007. Budd owns a gun store in Rural Hall, North Carolina. The father of home-schooled children, he also served as a board member for North Carolinians for Home Education. == U.S. House of Representatives == === Elections === ==== 2016 ==== Following court-mandated redistricting, the old 13th district essentially merged with the 2nd district. A new 13th district was created, stretching from the northern suburbs of Charlotte to Greensboro. The old 13th district's incumbent, Republican George Holding, opted to run in the 2nd district. Budd ran as one of 17 candidates in the ensuing Republican primary for the 13th district in the 2016 elections. His home had previously been in the 5th district but had been drawn into the 13th district. With the help of the Club for Growth, which spent over $285,000 on his campaign, Budd won the primary with 20% of the vote. He defeated Bruce Davis, a former Guilford County commissioner, in the general election with 56.1% of the vote. He was sworn into office on January 3, 2017. ==== 2018 ==== Budd was reelected in 2018, winning 51.5% to Kathy Manning's 45.8%. Manning was elected to represent the neighboring 6th district in 2020. ==== 2020 ==== In 2020, Budd was reelected with 68.2% of the vote defeating Democrat Scott Huffman, who won 31.8% of the vote. === House tenure === Budd voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and numerous Defense Authorization Spending Bills during the Trump administration. He also voted for the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which he said would open up more markets for North Carolina agricultural products. He opposed the American Rescue Plan Act, the Build Back Better Act, and the Infrastructure, Investment, and Jobs Act under President Biden. In late February 2021, Budd and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote in their place, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. He and the other members were actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their slated absences. In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,w5i95zlstl6lxi6,,,Ted Budd,senator,,250px_senator_ted_budd_official_portrait_28cropped_229jpg_denv4hsz7e.jpg,,,ted-budd,North Carolina,,,,,https://www.budd.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Budd,,
"Rafael Edward Cruz (; born December 22, 1970) is an American politician and attorney serving as the junior United States senator from Texas since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, Cruz was the solicitor general of Texas from 2003 to 2008. Since 2025, Cruz has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee. After graduating from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Arts and earning a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School, Cruz pursued a career in politics, eventually serving as a policy advisor in the George W. Bush administration. In 2003, Texas attorney general Greg Abbott appointed Cruz to serve as Solicitor General, a position he held until 2008. Cruz was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012, becoming the first Hispanic American to serve as a U.S. senator from Texas. In the Senate, he has taken consistently conservative positions on economic and social policy. He played a leading role in the 2013 federal government shutdown, seeking to force Congress and President Barack Obama to defund the Affordable Care Act. Cruz was reelected in a close race in 2018 against Democratic nominee Beto O'Rourke and won a third term in 2024 against Congressman Colin Allred. In 2025, he drafted and led the effort to pass the TAKE IT DOWN Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump. In May 2025, Cruz introduced a bill to create what later became Trump Accounts. In 2016, Cruz sought the Republican presidential nomination, emerging as a serious competitor to front-runner Donald Trump in a primary marked by intense, often personal, exchanges. Cruz initially withheld his endorsement after Trump secured the nomination, but became a strong supporter during Trump's first term. In 2021, Cruz objected to the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. == Early life and family == Rafael Edward Cruz was born on December 22, 1970, at Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to Eleanor Elizabeth (née Darragh) Wilson and Rafael Cruz. Cruz's mother was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She is of three-quarters Irish and one-quarter Italian descent, and earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Rice University in the 1950s. Cruz's father, Rafael, was born and raised in Cuba, the son of a Canary Islander who immigrated to Cuba as a child. As a teenager in the 1950s, Rafael Cruz was beaten by agents of Fulgencio Batista for opposing the Batista regime. He left Cuba in 1957 to attend the University of Texas at Austin and obtained political asylum in the United States after his four-year student visa expired. He earned Canadian citizenship in 1973 and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2005. At the time of his birth, Ted Cruz's parents had lived in Calgary for three years and were working in the oil business as owners of a seismic-data processing firm for oil drilling. Cruz has said that he is the son of ""two mathematicians/computer programmers"". In 1974, Cruz's father left the family and moved to Texas. Later that year, Cruz's parents reconciled and relocated the family to Houston. They divorced in 1997. Cruz has two older half-sisters, Miriam Ceferina Cruz and Roxana Lourdes Cruz, from his father's first marriage. Miriam died in 2011 from a drug overdose. Cruz began using the moniker ""Ted"" at age 13. === Education === For junior high school, Cruz",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,7febtguboa3ifif,,,Ted Cruz,senator,,250px_ted_cruz_official_116th_portrait_28cropped29jpg_n1uxiesmu7.jpg,,,ted-cruz,Texas,,,,,https://www.cruz.senate.gov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted%20Cruz,,

"Timothy Michael Kaine ( KAYN; born February 26, 1958) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the junior United States senator from Virginia since 2013. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 70th governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010, and as the 38th lieutenant governor of Virginia from 2002 to 2006. Kaine was the Democratic nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2016 election, as presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's running mate. Born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Kaine grew up in Overland Park, Kansas, graduated from the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School before entering private practice and becoming a lecturer at the University of Richmond School of Law.

The 2016 Democratic National Convention nominated him on July 27. Despite winning a plurality of the national popular vote, the Clinton–Kaine ticket lost the Electoral College, and therefore the election, to the Republican ticket of Donald Trump and Mike Pence on November 8, 2016.

"Timothy Eugene Scott (born September 19, 1965) is an American businessman and politician serving since 2013 as the junior United States senator from South Carolina. A member of the Republican Party, he is the first African-American senator in the Southern United States to be directly elected, the longest-serving African-American senator in U.S. history, the first African-American to serve in both the House and Senate, and the first African-American senator to chair a full committee. Born and raised in Charleston, Scott worked in financial services before entering politics. He served on the Charleston County Council from 1995 to 2009, was a member of the South Carolina General Assembly from 2009 to 2011, and represented South Carolina's 1st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013. In 2013, Governor Nikki Haley appointed Scott to the Senate after Jim DeMint resigned. Scott won the special election for the seat in 2014, and was elected to a full term in 2016 and reelected in 2022. In May 2023, Scott declared his candidacy for the 2024 Republican Party presidential nomination. He suspended his campaign in November due to low polling numbers. After the 2024 elections, Scott was elected chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He also chairs the Senate Committee on Banking. == Early life and education == Tim Scott was born on September 19, 1965, in North Charleston, South Carolina, to Frances, a nursing assistant, and Ben Scott Sr. When Scott was seven years old, his parents divorced, leaving him and his older brother, who later became a sergeant major in the U.S. Army, to grow up in working-class poverty with their mother, who often worked double shifts to support her family. After his parents divorced, Scott, his mother, and his older brother moved into his maternal grandparents' house. There, he formed a close bond with his grandfather. As a freshman at North Charleston's R.B. Stall High School, he failed several subjects, prompting his mother to send him to summer school, which he had to finance by working at a local movie theater. During this time, he met John Moniz, the owner of a nearby Chick-fil-A. Their initial interaction over a sandwich at Scott's workplace evolved into a substantial mentorship. Moniz educated Scott on individual responsibility, conservative business principles, philanthropy, and finance. From an early age, Scott enjoyed sports and excelled at football. He overcame racial prejudice in high school, securing election as student body vice president in his junior year and student body president as a senior. A month before his senior year, he fell asleep while driving, resulting in a car accident that dimmed his prospects as a football recruit. Nevertheless, he attended Presbyterian College from 1983 to 1984 on a partial football scholarship. He was introduced to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, an encounter that led him to his Christian faith, which became a central part of his life. Scott later transferred to Charleston Southern University, where he graduated in 1988 with a Bachelor of Science degree in political science. Upon graduating from college, Scott worked as an insurance agent and financial adviser, a stepping stone toward starting his insurance agency, Tim Scott Allstate. == Early political career == === Charleston County Council (1995–2009) === ==== Elections ==== Scott ran in a February 1995 special election",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,vzf4kkpdukjmik1,,,Tim Scott,senator,,250px_tim_scott_official_portraitjpg_7peylb2mne.jpg,,,tim-scott,South Carolina,,,,,https://www.scott.senate.gov/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott,,
"Timothy Patrick Sheehy ( SHEE-hee; born November 18, 1985) is an American politician, businessman, aerial firefighter, cattle rancher, and former Navy SEAL officer serving since 2025 as the junior United States senator from Montana. A member of the Republican Party, he is the youngest Republican U.S. senator and the second-youngest U.S. senator, after Jon Ossoff. Born and raised in Minnesota, Sheehy graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2008, commissioning as a naval officer that year. In 2012, he deployed to Afghanistan. In 2014, Sheehy founded Bridger Aerospace, an aerial firefighting and wildfire management company. In 2024, he defeated three-term Democratic incumbent senator Jon Tester. == Early life == Sheehy was born in Ramsey, Minnesota, in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area, and grew up in a lake house in Shoreview. He attended St. Paul Academy, graduating in 2004. == Military career == After high school, Sheehy attended the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating with a bachelor's degree in history in 2008. He was a Navy SEAL. He later attended Army Ranger School. During his military career, Sheehy did tours of duty in Iraq, Afghanistan, South America, and the Pacific region. Sheehy has said a bullet lodged in his arm during a 2012 Afghanistan firefight and that, suspecting it was from friendly fire, he did not report the incident at the time to protect his unit's members. In 2015, when seeking medical care in a Kalispell hospital, he said the injury was from an accidental discharge of a firearm in Glacier National Park that day. A park ranger cited Sheehy and fined him $525 for discharging his gun. Sheehy told The Washington Post that he ""made up the story about the gun going off to protect himself and his former platoonmates from facing a potential military investigation into an old bullet wound that he said he got in Afghanistan in 2012."" He has said that questioning whether he was shot in Afghanistan is ""tantamount to falsely accusing him of stolen valor"", but has declined to release his medical records and said records showing he received the bullet wound in Afghanistan do not exist. Sheehy left active duty in 2014 and was discharged from the Navy Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) in 2019. He wrote in his memoir and in a resume submitted to the Montana State Legislature that he had been medically discharged due to wounds received in Afghanistan. In October 2024, an NBC News review of Sheehy's discharge paperwork found that Sheehy voluntarily resigned from commission, contradicting his claims that he was discharged from the military because of injuries he sustained on duty. In 2015, Sheehy was awarded a Bronze Star with valor and a Purple Heart. Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke performed the ceremonial pinning of the medals. == Book == In 2023, Sheehy published a memoir, Mudslingers: A True Story of Aerial Firefighting. The Daily Montanan accused him of plagiarism in the book, giving four examples, the briefest a 27-word passage from Wikipedia. The memoir was not vetted by the U.S. Department of Defense Prepublication and Security Review (DOPSR) as required. == Business career == In 2014, Sheehy founded the company Bridger Aerospace.

"Christine Elizabeth Smith (née Flint, born March 4, 1958) is an American politician, retired Democratic political consultant, and former businesswoman serving as the junior United States senator from Minnesota since 2018. She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), an affiliate of the Democratic Party. Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Smith moved to Minnesota in the 1980s to work for General Mills and later became the vice president of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota. She then began a career as a political consultant and organizer for local Democratic candidates. Smith managed Walter Mondale's unsuccessful last-minute campaign in the 2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota after incumbent senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash 11 days before the election. After Mondale lost, Smith served as chief of staff to Mayor of Minneapolis R. T. Rybak. She then helped run Mark Dayton's successful campaign for Governor of Minnesota in 2010. After his victory, Dayton named Smith his chief of staff. Later, for Dayton's reelection campaign in the 2014 election, Smith was named as Dayton's pick for lieutenant governor. After winning her first election to public office, Smith served from 2015 to 2018 as Minnesota's 48th lieutenant governor. Dayton then appointed her to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Al Franken's resignation in 2018. She won the 2018 special election and was elected to a full term in 2020. On February 13, 2025, Smith announced that she will not run for reelection in 2026. == Early life and education == Smith was born on March 4, 1958, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the daughter of Christine, a teacher, and F. Harlan Flint, a lawyer. She mostly grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, attending Manderfield and Acequia Madre Elementary. She finished high school at Redwood High School in Larkspur, California. Before going to college, Smith worked on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. She graduated from Stanford University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science, and later earned a Master of Business Administration from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. == Early career == In 1984, Smith moved to Minnesota for a marketing job at General Mills. She later started her own marketing firm, where she consulted with businesses and nonprofits. In the early 1990s, Smith became involved in local politics, volunteering for DFL campaigns in Minneapolis. She managed Ted Mondale's unsuccessful 1998 campaign for governor. After Minnesota's U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash weeks before the 2002 election, Smith managed former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale's campaign for the seat. After Mondale lost a narrow election to Norm Coleman, Smith began working as the vice president of external affairs at Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. In 2006, Smith left her job at Planned Parenthood to serve as chief of staff to Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak. In 2010, she was picked to manage Rybak's gubernatorial campaign, which ended after Margaret Anderson Kelliher won the DFL endorsement. Smith then joined the campaign of Mark Dayton, who skipped the endorsing convention and eventually won the DFL primary. After Dayton defeated Republican Tom Emmer in the general election, Smith was named a co-chair of the transition. When Dayton took office in January 2011, he appointed Smith as his chief of staff.",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,sq4u0onwm396ic5,,,Tina Smith,senator,,250px_tina_smith2c_official_portrait2c_116th_congress_28cropped29jpg_242ztqxlm5.jpg,,,tina-smith,Minnesota,,,,,https://www.smith.senate.gov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Smith,,

"Thomas Hawley Tuberville (; TUH-bərv-il; born September 18, 1954) is an American politician, and retired college football coach and sports broadcaster who is the senior United States senator from Alabama, a seat he has held since 2021. He is a member of the Republican Party. Before entering politics, Tuberville was the head football coach at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008. He was also the head football coach at the University of Mississippi from 1995 to 1998, Texas Tech University from 2010 to 2012, and the University of Cincinnati from 2013 to 2016. Tuberville won five national coach-of-the-year awards (AP, AFCA, Sporting News, Walter Camp, and Bear Bryant) after Auburn's 13–0 season in 2004, in which Auburn won the Southeastern Conference title and the Sugar Bowl, but was left out of the BCS National Championship Game. He earned his 100th career win in 2007. Tuberville is the only Auburn football coach to beat in-state rival Alabama six consecutive times. In 2015, he was the president of the American Football Coaches Association. He worked for ESPN as a color analyst for its college football coverage during 2017. In his first political campaign, Tuberville ran for Senate in 2020, winning the Republican primary and defeating Democratic incumbent Doug Jones. Establishing himself as an ally of President Donald Trump, he was among a group of Republican senators who voted to object to the certification of the 2020 presidential election. In 2023, in protest of a Defense Department policy reimbursing travel for service members seeking abortions, Tuberville blocked all promotions of senior officers in the U.S. military for 10 months, delaying over 450 promotions. He initially planned to run for reelection to a second term, but later announced he would run for governor of Alabama in 2026 instead. == Early life and education == Tuberville was born and raised in Camden, Arkansas, one of three children of Olive Nell (née Chambliss) and Charles R. Tuberville Jr. He graduated from Harmony Grove High School in Camden in 1972. He attended Southern State College (now Southern Arkansas University), where he lettered in football as a safety for the Muleriders and played two years on the golf team. He received a B.S. in physical education from SSC in 1976. In 2008, he was inducted into the Southern Arkansas University Sports Hall of Fame and the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame. == Coaching career == === Early career === Tuberville first coached at Hermitage High School in Hermitage, Arkansas. He was an assistant coach at Arkansas State University. He then went through the ranks at the University of Miami, beginning as graduate assistant and ending as defensive coordinator in 1993, winning the national championship three times during his tenure there (1986–1994). In 1994, Tuberville replaced Bob Davie as defensive coordinator under R. C. Slocum at Texas A&M University. The Aggies went 10–0–1 that season. === Ole Miss === Tuberville got his first collegiate head coaching job in 1994 at the University of Mississippi (""Ole Miss""). Despite taking over a Rebels team under severe NCAA scholarship sanctions, he was named the SEC Coach of the Year in 1997 by the AP. At Ole Miss, Tuberville became involved in the movement to ban Confederate flags from the football stadium by requesting that the students quit waving them during the home",Senator,pbc_3830222512,politicians,U.S. Senator,,,bhogafzy93poixh,,,Tommy Tuberville,senator,,250px_tommy_tuberville2c_official_portrait2c_118th_congress_28slight_crop29jpg_2kzkwx8i0d.jpg,,,tommy-tuberville,Alabama,,,,,https://www.tuberville.senate.gov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Tuberville,,
